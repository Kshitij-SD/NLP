1 Harry,"I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall. Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumors true, Albus? I'm afraid so, professor. The good and the bad. - And the boy? - Hagrid is bringing him. Is it wise to trust Hagrid with something so important? Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life. Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall. - No problems, I trust, Hagrid? - No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep as we were flying over Bristol. Try not to wake him. There you go. Do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles. - They really are... - The only family he has. He'll be famous. Every child in our world will know his name. Exactly. He's far better off growing up away from all of that. Until he's ready. There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all. Good luck... ...Harry Potter. Up. Get up! Now! Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo! - Here he comes, the birthday boy. - Happy birthday, son. Cook breakfast. And try not to burn anything. - Yes, Aunt Petunia. - I want everything to be perfect... ...for my Dudley's special day! - Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy. - Yes, Uncle Vernon. Aren't they wonderful, darling? - How many are there? - 36. Counted them myself. 36?! But last year I had 37! - But some are bigger than last year's. - I don't care! This is what we're going to do. We're going to buy you two new presents. How's that, pumpkin? It should be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it. I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all... ...and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in. Make it move. Move! - Move! - He's asleep! He's boring. Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there... ...watching people press their ugly faces in on you. Can you hear me? It's just, I've never talked to a snake before. Do you? Do you talk to people often? You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there? Do you miss your family? I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents either. Mummy, Dad, you won't believe what this snake is doing! Thanks. Anytime. Snake! Mum! Mummy! Help me! My darling boy! How did you get in there? Who did this? How did you get in there? Is there a snake? It's all right, sweetheart. We'll get you out of these cold clothes. - What happened? - I swear, I don't know! The glass was there and then it was gone, like magic. There's no such thing as magic. Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk. - Dad, look! Harry's got a letter! - It's mine! Yours? Who'd be writing to you? No more mail through this letterbox. Have a lovely day at the office, dear. Shoo! Go on. Fine day, Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley? - Because there's no post on Sundays? - Right you are, Harry! No post on Sunday. No blasted letters today! No, sir. Not one single bloody letter. Not one! No, sir, not one blasted, miserable... Make it stop, please! Stop it! Mummy, what's happening? Give me that! Give me that letter! Get off! They're my letters! Let go of me! That's it! We're going away! Far away, where they can't find us! Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he? Make a wish, Harry. Who's there? Sorry about that. I demand that you leave at once. You are breaking and entering. Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry. You're a bit more along than I expected. Particularly in the middle. I'm not Harry. - I am. - Well, of course you are. Got something for you. Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same. Baked it myself, words and all. Thank you. It's not every day your young man turns 11, is it? Excuse me, but who are you? Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. - Of course, you know about Hogwarts. - Sorry, no. Didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all? Learned what? You're a wizard, Harry. - I'm a what? - A wizard. A good one, I'd wager, once you're trained up. No, you've made a mistake. I mean... ...I can't be a wizard. I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry. Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain, when you were angry or scared? ""Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to accept you... ...at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."" He will not be going! We swore we'd put a stop to all this rubbish. You knew? You knew all along and you never told me? Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. My mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. ""We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful?"" I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! Then she met that Potter, and then she had you... ...and I knew you would be the same. Just as strange, just as abnormal. And then she got herself blown up, and we got landed with you. Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash. A car crash? A car crash killed Lily and James Potter? - We had to say something. - It's an outrage! A scandal! He'll not be going. A great Muggle like you is going to stop him? Muggle? Non-magic folk. This boy's had his name down since he were born. He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry. He'll be under the finest headmaster Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore. I will not pay to have a crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks. Never insult Albus Dumbledore... ...in front of me. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. - I'm not allowed to do magic. - Okay. We're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. ""All students must be equipped with... ...one standard size 2 pewter cauldron... ...and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad."" Can we find all this in London? If you know where to go. Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume? No, thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business. Just helping Harry buy his school supplies. Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter! Welcome back, Mr. Potter. Welcome back. Doris Crockford. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last. Harry Potter. Can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you. Hello, professor. I didn't see you. Professor Quirrell will be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Oh, nice to meet you. Fearfully fascinating subject. Not that you need it, eh, Potter? Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Goodbye. - See, Harry? You're famous. - But why am I famous? All those people, how is it they know who I am? I'm not sure I'm the right person to tell you that. Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley. Here, you get your quills and ink. Over there, all your bits and bobs for doing wizardry. It's a world-class racing broom. Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet. But how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money. There's your money. Gringotts, the wizard bank. Ain't no safer place, not one. Except perhaps Hogwarts. Hagrid, what exactly are these things? They're goblins. Clever as they come, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stay close. Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal. And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key? Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Ha! There's the little devil. And there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about You-Know-What in vault you-know-which. Very well. Vault 687. Lamp, please. Key, please. Did you think your parents would leave you with nothing? - Vault 713. - What's in there, Hagrid? Can't tell you. Hogwarts business. Very secret. Stand back. Best not to mention this to anyone. I still need a wand. You want Ollivanders. There ain't no place better. Run along there and wait. I got one more thing to do. Hello? Hello? I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday... ...that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. Here we are. Give it a wave. Apparently not. Perhaps... ...this. No, no, definitely not. No matter. I wonder... Curious. Very curious. Sorry, but what's curious? I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It so happens that the phoenix... ...whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand... ...when its brother gave you that scar. And who owned that wand? We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it is clear... ...that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named... ...did great things. Terrible... ...yes, but great. Harry! Harry! Happy birthday. You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet. He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid. I know you do. First, and understand this because it's very important: Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago... ...there was a wizard who went as bad as you can go. His name was V... - His name was V... - Maybe if you wrote it down? No, I can't spell it. - All right, Voldemort. - Voldemort? It was dark times, Harry. <i>Voldemort started to gather some followers.</i> <i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i> <i>Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.</i> <i>Your parents fought against him.</i> <i>But nobody lived once he decided to kill them.</i> <i>Nobody, not one.</i> <i>Except you.</i> Me? Voldemort tried to kill me? Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, an evil curse. What happened to V? To You-Know-Who? Well, some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there still... ...too tired to carry on. But one thing's certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived. What are you looking at? Blimey, is that the time? I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore will be wanting his... Well, he'll be wanting to see me. Your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket, that's very important. ""Platform 93/4""? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says platform 93/4. There's no such thing, is there? Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. On your left. Can you tell me where I might find platform 93/4? Think you're being funny, do you? It's the same every year, packed with Muggles. - Muggles? - Platform 93/4, this way. All right, Percy, you first. Fred, you next. - He's not Fred, I am. - You call yourself our mother? I'm sorry, George. I'm only joking. I am Fred. Excuse me. Could you tell me how to? How to get onto the platform? Not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. All you do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. - Best to run if you're nervous. - Good luck. Excuse me. Do you mind? Everywhere else is full. Not at all. I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley. I'm Harry. Harry Potter. So it's true! I mean, do you really have the? - The what? - The scar? Wicked! - Anything off the trolley, dears? - No, thanks. I'm all set. We'll take the lot. - Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans? - They mean every flavor. There's chocolate and peppermint and also... ...spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a booger-flavored one once. - Are they real frogs? - It's a spell. You want the cards. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I've got about 500 meself. Watch it! That's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them. - I've got Dumbledore! - I got about six of him. Hey, he's gone! You can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? This is Scabbers. Pathetic, isn't he? A little. Fred gave me a spell to turn him yellow. Want to see? Yeah. Has anyone seen a toad? - A boy named Neville's lost one. - No. Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see, then. <i>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</i> <i>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</i> Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've only tried a few simple ones myself... ...but they've all worked for me. For example: <i>Oculus Reparo.</i> That's better, isn't it? Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter! I'm Hermione Granger. And you are? - I'm Ron Weasley. - Pleasure. You two better change into robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your nose. Did you know? Just there. Right, then. First years, this way, please! Come on, first years, don't be shy. Come on now, hurry up. - Hello, Harry. - Hi, Hagrid. Right, then. This way to the boats. Come on now, follow me. Wicked. Welcome to Hogwarts. Shortly, you'll pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff... ...Ravenclaw and Slytherin. While you're here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points. Any rule-breaking and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points wins the house cup. Trevor! Sorry. The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily. It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. Harry Potter? This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. Think my name's funny, do you? I've no need to ask yours. Red hair and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. You'll find out some wizarding families are better than others. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks. We're ready for you now. Follow me. The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched to look like the night sky. <i>I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.</i> Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin... ...Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words. I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce. The first years, please note... ...that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you... ...that the third-floor corridor is out of bounds... ...to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you. When I call your name, you will come forth. I shall place the Sorting Hat on your head... ...and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger. Oh, no. Okay, relax. Mental, that one, I'm telling you. Right, then. Right. Okay. Gryffindor! Draco Malfoy. Slytherin! Every wizard who went bad was in Slytherin. Susan Bones. Harry, what is it? Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine. Let's see... I know! Hufflepuff! Ronald Weasley. Another Weasley! I know just what to do with you. Gryffindor! Harry Potter. Difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh, yes. And a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you? Not Slytherin, not Slytherin! Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It's all here, in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that. No? Well, if you're sure. Better be... ...Gryffindor! Your attention, please. Let the feast begin. I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out. Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell? Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house. - What's he teach? - Potions. But he fancies the Dark Arts. He's been after Quirrell's job for years. Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor. It's the Bloody Baron! Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer? Dismal. Once again, my request to join the Headless Hunt has been denied. I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick. I prefer Sir Nicholas, if you don't mind. ""Nearly"" headless? How can you be nearly headless? Like this. Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you. Ravenclaw, follow me. This way. This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Keep an eye on the staircases. They like to change. Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. That picture's moving. - Look at that one. - I think she fancies you. - Look! - Who's that girl? Welcome to Hogwarts. Password? Caput Draconis. Follow me, everyone. Keep up. Quickly, come on. Gather around here. Welcome to the Gryffindor common room. Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left. Girls, the same on your right. Your belongings have already been brought up. Made it! Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late? - That was bloody brilliant! - Thank you for that assessment. It'd be better if I transfigured Mr. Potter and you into a watch. - Then one of you might be on time. - We got lost. Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats. There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate... ...the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few... ...who possess the predisposition... ...I can teach you how to bewitch the mind... ...and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame... ...brew glory and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts with abilities... ...so formidable that you feel confident enough... ...to not pay attention. Mr. Potter. Our new celebrity. What would I get if I added root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? You don't know? Let's try again. Where would you look if I asked you to find a bezoar? I don't know, sir. What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane? I don't know, sir. Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything... ...is it, Mr. Potter? <i>Eye of rabbit, harp string hum Turn this water into rum</i> <i>Eye of rabbit...</i> What's Seamus trying to do to the water? Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before... Mail's here. Can I borrow this? Thanks. Look, Neville's got a Remembrall. I've read about those. The smoke turns red when you've forgotten something. The problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten. Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen. ""Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches... ...Gringotts goblins acknowledge the breach but insist nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had been emptied earlier that same day."" That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to. - Good afternoon, class. - Good afternoon, Madam Hooch. Good afternoon, Amanda. Good afternoon. Welcome to your first flying lesson. What are you waiting for? Step up to your broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand over the broom and say, ""Up."" Up! Up. Up. Up. Up! With feeling. Shut up, Harry. Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. Grip it tight. You don't wanna be sliding off the end. When I blow my whistle, I want you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment... ...then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle. Three, two... Mr. Longbottom. - Mr. Longbottom! - Down, down! Neville! Come back down this instant! Everyone out of the way! Is he all right? Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist. Poor boy. Come on now, up you get. Keep your feet on the ground while I take him to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air... ...the one riding it will be expelled before they can say Quidditch. Did you see his face? If he had squeezed this, he'd have remembered to fall on his arse. Give it here, Malfoy. No. I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. How about on the roof? What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach? Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said. Besides, you don't know how to fly. What an idiot. Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom! Is that so? Have it your way, then. - Nice going, Harry. - That was wicked, Harry! Harry Potter! Follow me. You wait here. Professor Quirrell, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment? Yes, of course. Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker. Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well. Seeker? But first years never make the house teams. - You must be the youngest player in... - A century, McGonagall says. Well done, Harry. Wood's just told us. Fred and George are on the team. Beaters. Our job is to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises. Rough game, Quidditch. But no one's died in years. Someone vanishes occasionally. But they'll turn up in a month or two. Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game there is, and you'll be great too. I've never played. What if I make a fool of myself? You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood. You never told me your father was a Seeker too. I didn't know. I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do. Who doesn't? What's happening? The staircases change, remember? - Let's go this way. - Before the staircase moves again. Does anybody feel like we shouldn't be here? We're not supposed to be here. This is the third floor. It's forbidden. Let's go. - It's Filch's cat! - Run! Quick, let's hide through that door! - It's locked! - We're done for! Move over! <i>Alohomora.</i> Get in. <i>Alohomora?</i> <i>Standard Book of Spells, chapter seven.</i> Anyone here, my sweet? Come on. - Filch is gone. - He thinks this door's locked. - It was locked. - And for good reason. What are they doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school? Didn't you see what it was standing on? I wasn't looking at its feet! I was preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. There were three! It was standing on a trap door. It wasn't there by accident. - It's guarding something. - Guarding something? That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed... ...before you come up with another idea to get us killed. Or worse, expelled. She needs to sort out her priorities. Quidditch is easy to understand. Each team has seven players. Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls. This one's called the Quaffle. The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those hoops. The Keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. With me so far? I think so. What are those? You better take this. Careful now, it's coming back. Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater. What was that? Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are a Seeker. The only thing I want you to worry about is this. The Golden Snitch. - I like this ball. - You like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see. What do I do with it? You catch it. Before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game's over. You catch this, Potter, and we win. One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation... ...or the ability to make objects fly. Do you have your feathers? Good. Now, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing. The swish and flick. Everyone. The swish and flick. Good. Oh, and enunciate. <i>Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go, then.</i> <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i> <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i> No, stop, stop, stop! You're going to take someone's eye out. <i>Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.</i> You do it then, if you're so clever. Go on, go on. <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i> Well done! See here, everyone, Miss Granger's done it! Splendid! Well done, dear. I think we're going to need another feather over here. <i>""It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.""</i> She's a nightmare, honestly! No wonder she hasn't got any friends. I think she heard you. Where's Hermione? Parvati said she wouldn't come out of the bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon, crying. Troll in the dungeon! Troll in the dungeon! Thought you ought to know. Silence! Everyone will please not panic! Now... ...prefects will lead their house back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons. Gryffindors, keep up, please, and stay alert. How could a troll get in? Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. - What? - Hermione! She doesn't know. I think the troll's left the dungeon. It's going into the girls' bathroom. Hermione, move! Help! Help! Hey, pea brain! Help! Do something! - What? - Anything! - Hurry up! - Swish and flick. <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i> Cool. Is it dead? I don't think so. Just knocked out. Troll boogers. Oh, my goodness! Explain yourselves, both of you! - Well, what it is... - It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. Miss Granger? I went looking for the troll. I thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me, I'd probably be dead. Be that as it may, it was an extremely foolish thing to do. I expected more rational behavior and am very disappointed in you. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor... ...for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen... ...I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many first-year students could take on a troll... ...and live to tell the tale. Five points... ...will be awarded to each of you... ...for sheer dumb luck. Perhaps you ought to go. It might wake up. Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on. Ron's right. You'll need your strength today. I'm not hungry. Good luck today, Potter. You've proven yourself against a troll. A game of Quidditch should be easy work. Even if it is against Slytherin. - That explains the blood. - Blood? Last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion... ...so he could get past that dog. But he got bit, that's why he's limping. But why would anyone go near that dog? At Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of the vault. Said it was Hogwarts business, very secret. You're saying... That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants. - Bit early for mail, isn't it? - But I never get mail. Let's open it. It's a broomstick. That's not just a broomstick, it's a Nimbus 2000! But who? - Scared, Harry? - A little. It's all right. I felt the same way before my first game. - What happened? - I don't really remember. I took a Bludger to the head two minutes in. Woke up in hospital a week later. Welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season. Today's game, Slytherin versus Gryffindor! The players take their positions... ...as Madam Hooch steps onto the field to begin the game! Now, I want a nice, clean game... ...from all of you! The Bludgers are up, followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the Snitch is worth 150 points. The Seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game. The Quaffle is released and the game begins! Angelina Johnson scores! Ten points for Gryffindor! Well done! Slytherin takes the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint. Another 10 points to Gryffindor! Give me that! Take that side! What's going on with Harry's broomstick? It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom! - Jinxing the broom? What do we do? - Leave it to me. Come on, Hermione! <i>Lacarnum Inflamarae.</i> Fire! You're on fire! Go, go, go, go! Looks like he's gonna be sick. He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch! Gryffindor wins! Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom? Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog? - Who told you about Fluffy? - Fluffy? - That thing has a name? - Of course he has a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irishman. I lent him to Dumbledore to guard... Shouldn't have said that. No more questions! That's top-secret. But whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it. Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher. Teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking. Exactly. Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel. Nicholas Flamel? I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. Nicholas Flamel. Who's Nicholas Flamel? I don't know. <i>Merry Christmas Merry Christmas</i> <i>Ring the Hogwart bell</i> <i>Merry Christmas Merry Christmas</i> <i>Cast a Christmas spell</i> Knight to e5. Queen to e5. That's totally barbaric! That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed. I see you haven't. Change of plans. My parents went to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. - He's studying dragons there. - Good. You can help Harry. He's going to the library to look up Nicholas Flamel. We've looked a hundred times! Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas. I think we've had a bad influence on her. Harry, wake up! Come on, Harry, wake up! - Happy Christmas, Harry. - Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing? Oh, my mum made it. Looks like you've got one too. - I've got presents? - Yeah. There they are. ""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."" - What is it? - Some kind of cloak. Well, let's see, then. Put it on. My body's gone! I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak! I'm invisible? They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you. There was no name. It just said, ""Use it well."" <i>Famous Fire-Eaters. Fifteenth-Century Fiends.</i> Flamel. Nicholas Flamel. Where are you? Who's there? I know you're in there. You can't hide. Who is it? Show yourself. Severus, I... You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell. - I don't know what you mean. - You know perfectly well what I mean. We'll have another little chat soon. When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie. Professors. I found this in the restricted section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed. Mum? Dad? Ron, you've really gotta see this! Ron, you've gotta see this! Ron, come on, get out of bed! - Why? - There's something you've got to see! Come on! Come! Come look, it's my parents! I only see us. Look in properly. Go on, stand there. - There. You see them, don't you? - That's me! Only I'm head boy. And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup. And bloody hell! I'm Quidditch captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future? How can it? Both my parents are dead. Back again, Harry? I see that you, like many before you... ...have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth... ...would look in the mirror and see only himself... ...exactly as he is. So then, it shows us what we want. Whatever we want. Yes. And no. It shows us nothing more or less... ...than the deepest and most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, Harry, who have never known your family... ...you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge... ...or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it. Even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home. And I must ask you... ...not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams... ...and forget to live. I had you looking in the wrong section. How could I be so stupid? I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading. This is light? Of course! Here it is! Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone. The what? Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It'll transform any metal into pure gold... ...and produces the Elixir of Life which will make the drinker immortal."" - Immortal? - It means you'll never die. I know what it means! ""The only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel... ...the noted alchemist who last year celebrated his 665th birthday."" That's what Fluffy's guarding. That's what's under the trap door. The Philosopher's Stone. Don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no state to entertain. We know about the Philosopher's Stone. - We think Snape's trying to steal it. - Are you still on about him? We know he's after it. We don't know why. Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone. He won't steal it. What? You heard. Come on, I'm a bit preoccupied today. Wait a minute. ""One of the teachers""? There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? - Spells, enchantments. - Right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me. Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Ain't a soul knows how, except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I should not have told you that. - Hagrid, what exactly is that? - That? It's... I know what that is! But, Hagrid, how did you get one? I won it. Off a stranger I met down at the pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid of it, as a matter of fact. Is that... ...a dragon? That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback. My brother works with these in Romania. Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him. Look, he knows his mummy. Hello, Norbert. - Norbert? - He's gotta have a name, don't he? Don't you, Norbert? He'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. Who's that? Malfoy. Oh, dear. Hagrid always wanted a dragon. Told me so the first time I met him. It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows. - I don't understand. Is that bad? - It's bad. Good evening. Nothing, I repeat, nothing... ...gives a student the right to walk about at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken. - 50?! - Each. To ensure it doesn't happen again... ...all four of you will receive detention. Excuse me, professor, perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said the four of us. No, you heard me correctly. Honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will join your classmates in detention. A pity they let the old punishments die. Was a time detention found you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the Dark Forest. A sorry lot, this, Hagrid. Good God, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you? Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony. That's good, isn't it? He's with his own kind. What if he don't like Romania? What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby. For God's sake, pull yourself together. You're going into the Forest. Got to have your wits about you. The Forest? I thought that was a joke. We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are... ...werewolves. There's more than werewolves in those trees. You can be sure of that. Nighty-night. Right. Let's go. Hagrid, what is that? What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been hurt bad by something. So, it's our job to go and find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, come with me. And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. Okay. Then I get Fang. Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. Wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were scared. I'm not scared, Potter. Do you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared! What is it, Fang? Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The Forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you. What was that thing you saved me from? A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking its blood will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. For you have slain something so pure... ...that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life. - Who would choose such a life? - Can you think of no one? Do you mean to say that that thing that killed the unicorn... ...that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort? Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment? The Philosopher's Stone. Harry! Hello there, Firenze. See you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck. You mean, You-Know-Who is out there right now in the Forest? But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants it for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll come back. But if he comes back... ...you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you? If he'd had the chance, he might have tried tonight. And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final. Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore is around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore is around, you can't be touched. I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were frightful, but I found that enjoyable. Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry? - My scar. It keeps burning. - It's happened before. - Not like this. - You should see the nurse. I think it's a warning. It means danger's coming. - Of course! - What is it? Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon... ...and a stranger just happens to have one? How many people wander around with dragon eggs? Why didn't I see it before? Who gave you the egg? What did he look like? I never saw his face. He kept his hood up. You and this stranger must have talked. He wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."" - Was he interested in Fluffy? - Of course he was interested. How often do you come across a three-headed dog? But I told him, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him."" Take Fluffy, for example. Play him music and he falls straight to sleep. I shouldn't have told you that. Where are you going? We have to see Dumbledore. Immediately! I'm afraid he's not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left. He's gone? But this is important! This is about the Philosopher's Stone! - How do you know? - Someone's going to try and steal it. I don't know how you know, but I assure you it is well protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. That was no stranger Hagrid met. It was Snape. Which means he knows how to get past Fluffy. - And with Dumbledore gone... - Good afternoon. What would three young Gryffindors... ...be doing inside on a day like this? - We were just... - You ought to be careful. People will think you're... ...up to something. Now what do we do? We go down the trap door. Tonight. Trevor. Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here! Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, aren't you? - Neville, listen. We were... - No, I won't let you! You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again. I'll fight you. <i>Neville, I'm really sorry about this. Petrificus Totalus.</i> You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant, but scary. Let's go. - Sorry. - It's for your own good, you know. - You stood on my foot! - Sorry. <i>Alohomora.</i> Wait a minute. He's... ...snoring. Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. It's got horrible breath. - We have to move its paw. - What? Come on! Okay. Push. I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. If something bad happens, get yourselves out. Does it seem a bit quiet to you? The harp. It's stopped playing. Jump! Lucky this plant thing's here, really. Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster. Kill us faster? Oh, now I can relax! Hermione! - Now what are we gonna do? - Just relax! - Hermione, where are you? - Do what I say! Trust me. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - He's not relaxing, is he? - Apparently not. - We've gotta do something. - What? I remember reading something in Herbology. Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. It's deadly fun... ...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! It hates sunlight. <i>Lumus Solem.</i> - Ron, you okay? - Yeah. Lucky we didn't panic. Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology. What is that? I don't know. Sounds like wings. Curious. I've never seen birds like these. They're not birds. They're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. - What's this all about? - I don't know. Strange. <i>Alohomora!</i> Well, it was worth a try. What will we do? There must be a thousand keys. We want a big, old-fashioned one. Probably rusty. I see it! The one with the broken wing. What's wrong? It's too simple. Go on! If Snape could catch it on that old broomstick, you can. You're the youngest Seeker in a century. This complicates things a bit. Catch the key! Hurry up! I don't like this. I don't like this at all. Where are we? A graveyard. This is no graveyard. It's a chessboard. There's the door. Now what do we do? It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. Harry, you take the empty bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the queen-side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. What happens now? Well, white moves first. And then... ...we play. Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like... ...real wizard's chess, do you? You there, d5. Yes, Hermione. I think this is gonna be exactly like wizard's chess. Castle to e4! Pawn to c3! - Wait a minute. - You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the queen will take me. Then you're free to check the king. - No. Ron, no! - What is it? - He's going to sacrifice himself. - No, there must be another way! Do you wanna stop Snape from getting that Stone or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You. Knight to h3. Check. Ron! No, don't move! Don't forget, we're still playing. Checkmate. Take care of Ron. Then go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on. You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard. You really are. Not as good as you. Me? Books and cleverness. There are more important things. Friendship and bravery. And, Harry, just be careful. You? No, it can't be. Snape, he was the... Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to him, who would suspect... ...poor, stuttering Professor Quirrell? But that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me. No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! If Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact... ...I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his countercurse. Snape was trying to save me? I knew you were a danger to me, especially after Halloween. - Then you let the troll in! - Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone ran about, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it? Use the boy. Come here, Potter! Now! Tell me, what do you see? What is it? What do you see? I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup. He lies. Tell the truth! What do you see? - Let me speak to him. - Master, you are not strong enough. I have strength enough for this. Harry Potter... ...we meet again. Voldemort. Yes. You see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me... ...but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. Stop him! Don't be a fool. Why suffer an horrific death... ...when you can join me and live? Never! Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry... ...would you like to see your mother and father again? Together... ...we can bring them back. All I ask is for something in return. That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power... ...and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the Stone! You liar! Kill him! - What is this magic? - Fool, get the Stone! Good afternoon, Harry. - Tokens from your admirers? - Admirers? What happened in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a secret. So, naturally, the whole school knows. I see that your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble... ...of opening your Chocolate Frogs. Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione? Fine. They're both just fine. - What happened to the Stone? - Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I have had a little chat... ...and agreed it was best all around. But then, Flamel, he'll die, won't he? He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die. How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror and... You see, only a person... ...who wanted to find the Stone, find it... ...but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me, that is saying something. Does that mean, with the Stone gone, that Voldemort can never come back? I'm afraid... ...there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why... ...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark. No, this kind of mark cannot be seen. - It lives in your very skin. - What is it? Love, Harry. Love. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one. And since then, I've lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe... ...with a nice toffee. Alas! Earwax. - All right there, Ron? - All right. You? All right. Hermione? Never better. Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding. And the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. Third place, Hufflepuff with 352 points. In second place... ...Ravenclaw with 426 points. And in first place... ...with 472 points, Slytherin house. Nice one, mate. Yes, well done, Slytherin. Well done. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last-minute points to award. To Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect... ...while others were in grave peril... ...50 points. Good job. Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best-played game of chess... ...that Hogwarts has seen these many years, 50 points. And third... ...to Mr. Harry Potter... ...for pure nerve and outstanding courage... ...I award Gryffindor house 60 points. We're tied with Slytherin! Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies... ...but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points... ...to Neville Longbottom. Assuming that my calculations are correct... ...I believe that a change of decoration is in order. Gryffindor wins the house cup. Come on, now. Hurry up, you'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Come on, hurry up. - Come on, Harry. - One minute. Thought you were leaving without saying goodbye, did you? This is for you. Thanks, Hagrid. Go on. On with you. On with you now. Oh, listen, Harry. If that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief... ...you could always threaten him... ...with a nice pair of ears to go with his tail. But we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that. I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it? I'm not going home.

2 Harry,"I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. - Besides, if Uncle Vernon... - Harry Potter! Now you've done it. He's in there. Vernon? I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go. But she's bored. If I could only let her out for an hour or two. So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir. But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends. Not one... ...all summer. Who would want to be friends with you? I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table... ...even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... ...purely out of the goodness of our hearts. Not now. It's for when the Masons arrive. Which should be any minute. Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...? In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home. - Good. And, Dudley, you will be...? - I'll be waiting to open the door. Excellent. And you? I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist. Too right, you will. With any luck, this could be the day I make the biggest deal of my career... ...and you will not mess it up. Harry Potter, such an honor it is. - Who are you? - Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf. Not to be rude or anything... ...but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom. Yes, sir. Dobby understands. It's just that Dobby has come to tell you... It is difficult, sir. Dobby wonders where to begin. - Why don't you sit down? - Sit down? Sit down? Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything. Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir... ...but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal. You can't have met many decent wizards then. No, I haven't. That was an awful thing to say. - Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! - Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush. Dobby, please, stop. Don't mind that. It's just the cat. - Bad Dobby. - Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet. Are you all right? Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. - Your family? - The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here... But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. Harry Potter must not go back... ...to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen. What terrible things? Who's plotting them? Can't say. - Okay, I understand. You can't say. - Don't make me talk. L... - Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down. - Bad Dobby. So when they arrive at the ninth hole... Give me the lamp. Dobby, stop! - Let me go. - Get in there and keep quiet. - What the devil are you doing up here? - I was just... You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. Sorry. One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy. - And fix that door. - Yes, sir. See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. - It's the only place I've got friends. - Friends who don't write to Harry Potter? Well, I expect they've been... Hang on. How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me? Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him... ...Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir. - Give me those. Now. - No! Dobby, get back here. Dobby, please, no. Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school. I can't. Hogwarts is my home. Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good. It spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this building. One plumber said, ""Look at all that water. "" The second plumber said, ""Yes, and that's just the top of it. "" I'm so sorry. It's my nephew. He's very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs. You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never! Hiya, Harry. Ron. Fred. George. What are you all doing here? Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on, get your trunk. You better stand back. Let's go. - What was that? - What was it? Potter! Dad, what's going on? Go. Go. Go. Dad, hurry up. - Come on. - Come on, Harry, hurry up. Petunia, he's escaping! - I've got you, Harry. - Come here! - Let go of me! - No, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere. - Get off! - Drive! - Right. - Right! No! No! No! No! Dad! Damn. By the way, Harry, happy birthday. Come on. Okay, come on. Okay, come on. - Think it'd be all right if we had some? - Yeah, Mum will never know. It's not much, but it's home. I think it's brilliant. Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you, dear. Beds empty. No note. Car gone. You could have died. You could have been seen. Of course, I don't blame you, Harry, dear. They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window. Well, you best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley. Come on, Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in. That's it. There we go. - Mummy, have you seen my jumper? - Yes, dear, it was on the cat. Hello. What did I do? Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying, really. - Morning, Weasleys. - Morning, Dad. - What a night. Nine raids. Nine! - Raids? Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating. Well, now. And who are you? Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir. Harry Potter. Good Lord. Are you really? Well, Ron has told us all about you, of course. When did he get here? This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night. Did you really? How did it go? I mean... That was very wrong indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck? Well, that'll be Errol with the post. Fetch it, will you, Percy, please? - Errol. - He's always doing that. Look, it's our Hogwarts letters. They've sent us Harry's as well. Dumbledore must know you're here. Doesn't miss a trick, that man. - No. - This lot won't come cheap. - The spell books alone are expensive. - We'll manage. There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley. Right. Here we are, Harry. You go first, dear. But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum. Floo powder? You go first, Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go. That's it. Diagon Alley. You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it. Mind your head. That's right. Now, take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly. Diagonally. - What did he say, dear? - Diagonally. I thought he did. - Not lost, are you, my dear? - I'm fine, thank you. I was just going... Come with us. We'll help you find your way back. - No. Please... - Harry? Hagrid! What do you think you're doing down here? Come on. You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place. Don't want no one to see you there. People will think you're up to no good. I was lost, I... Hang on. What were you doing down there then? Me? I was... I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent. They're ruining all the school cabbages. Harry. Hagrid. Hello, Hermione. - It's so good to see you. - It's great to see you too. What did you do to your glasses? <i>Oculus Reparo.</i> I definitely need to remember that one. You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it. - Okay, bye. - Thank you. Bye. Come on, everyone's been so worried. Harry. Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart. Here he is. Mum fancies him. Make way there, please. Let me by, madam. Thank you. <i>Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet.</i> It can't be. Harry Potter? Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam. Nice big smile, Harry. Together, you and I rate the front page. Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning... <i>...to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me...</i> ...which, incidentally, is currently celebrating... <i>...its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list...</i> ...he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving... ...with my entire collected works... ...free of charge. Now, ladies? Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it. I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a bookshop without making the front page. Leave him alone. Look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend. Now, now, Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter. Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me. Your scar is legend. As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you. Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer. You must be very brave to mention his name. Or very foolish. Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. And you must be Miss Granger. Yes, Draco has told me all about you. And your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me see. Red hair, vacant expressions... ...tatty, secondhand book. You must be the Weasleys. It's mad in here. Let's go outside. - Well, well, well. Weasley senior. - Lucius. Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime... ...but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard... ...if they don't even pay you well for it? We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy. Clearly. Associating with Muggles. And I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work. See you at school. - 10:58, come on. - The train will be leaving any moment. Fred, George, Percy, you first. Okay. After you, dear. Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry. Let's go. - What do you two think you're doing? - Sorry. Lost control of the trolley. - Why can't we get through? - I don't know. The gateway has sealed itself for some reason. The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it. Harry, if we can't get through... ...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back. Maybe we should just go and wait by the car. The car. Ron, I should tell you... ...most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car. Right. Okay. Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty. Come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train. Okay. All we need to do is catch up with the train. We can't be far behind. - Do you hear that? - We must be getting close. Hold on. Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on! I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty. - I think we found the train. - Yeah. Welcome home. Up! Up! It's not working! Up! Ron, mind that tree! Stop! Stop! Stop! - My wand. Look at my wand. - Be thankful it's not your neck. - What's happening? - I don't know. Come on, go! Fast! Scabbers, you're okay. The car! Dad's gonna kill me. See you, Hedwig. So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom... ...we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4... ...we almost get killed by a tree... Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year. Well, take a good look, lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Oh, dear, we are in trouble. You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow... ...that's been on these grounds since before you were born. Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us. Silence. I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me... ...the both of you would be on the train home tonight. - As it is... - They are not. Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall. Headmaster... ...these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. - As such... - I am well aware of our bylaws... ...having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house... ...it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action. We'll go and get our stuff, then. What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley? You're going to expel us, aren't you? Not today, Mr. Weasley... ...but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention. Morning, everyone. - Good morning, everyone. - Good morning, Professor Sprout. Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second years. Gather around, everyone. Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger? Mandrake, or Mandragora... ...is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it. Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings... ...their cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for hours, which is why I have given you earmuffs... ...for auditory protection. So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly. Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly. You pull it sharply up out of the pot. Got it? And... ...now you dunk it down into the other pot... ...and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm. Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs. - No, ma'am, he's just fainted. - Yes, well, just leave him there. Right, on we go. Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up. - There's Nearly Headless Nick. - Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater. Hello, Sir Nicholas. Say it. I'm doomed. - You're doomed. - Hi, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too. Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you. Ron, is that your owl? Bloody bird's a menace. Oh, no. Look, everyone. Weasley's got himself a Howler. Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible. <i>Ronald Weasley!</i> <i>How dare you steal that car! I am absolutely disgusted!</i> <i>Your father's now facing an inquiry at work...</i> <i>...nd it's entirely your fault!</i> <i>If you put another toe out of line...</i> <i>...we'll bring you straight home!</i> <i>And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor.</i> <i>Your father and I are so proud.</i> Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart... ...Order of Merlin, Third Class... ...honorary member of the Dark Force Defense League... ...and five times winner... <i>...of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award.</i> But I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Now, be warned. It is my job to arm you... ...against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them. Cornish pixies? Freshly caught Cornish pixies. Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan... ...but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them. Come on now, round them up. They're only pixies. - You just stay there! - Please, get me down! - Get off me! - Stop. Hold still! <i>Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</i> I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage. What do we do now? <i>Immobulus!</i> Why is it always me? I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer. What...? I don't believe it. - Where you think you're going, Flint? - Quidditch practice. - I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today. - Easy, Wood. I've got a note. I smell trouble. ""I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team... ...permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker. "" You've got a new Seeker. Who? - Malfoy? - That's right. And that's not all that's new this year. Those are Nimbus 2001 s. How did you get those? A gift from Draco's father. You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best. At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent. No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood. You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs! You okay, Ron? Say something. - Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry? - No, Colin, get out of the way. Let's take him to Hagrid's. He'll know what to do. This calls for a specialist's equipment. Nothing to do but wait till it stops, I'm afraid. - Okay. - Better out than in. - Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway? - Malfoy. He called Hermione... Well, I don't know exactly what it means. He called me a Mudblood. - He did not. - What's a Mudblood? It means ""dirty blood. "" Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation. See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family... ...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood. That's horrible. It's disgusting. And it's codswallop to boot. Dirty blood. Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood or less. More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do. Come here. Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute. Harry, Harry, Harry. Can you possibly imagine... ...a better way to serve detention... ...than by helping me to answer my fan mail? Not really. Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that. <i>Come.</i> <i>Come...</i> <i>...to me.</i> - What? - Sorry? That voice. Voice? - Didn't you hear it? - What are you talking about, Harry? I think you're getting a bit drowsy. And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the time. We've been here nearly four hours. Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun. Spooky. <i>Blood.</i> <i>I smell blood.</i> <i>Let me rip you.</i> <i>Let me kill you.</i> <i>Kill!</i> <i>Kill!</i> <i>- Kill! - Harry!</i> - Did you hear it? - Hear what? - That voice. - Voice? What voice? I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just... <i>It's time.</i> It's moving. I think it's going to kill. - Kill? - Harry, wait! Not so fast! Strange. - I've never seen spiders act like that. - I don't like spiders. What's that? ""The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware. "" It's written in blood. Oh, no. It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris. ""Enemies of the Heir, beware. "" You'll be next, Mudbloods. What's going on here? Go on. Make way, make way. Potter? What are you...? Mrs. Norris? - You've murdered my cat. - No. No. I'll kill you. - I'll kill you! - Argus! Argus, I... Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except... ...you three. Ravenclaws, follow me. She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified. Thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her. But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say. Ask him. It's him that's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall. It's not true, sir. I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris. - Rubbish. - Lf I might, headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. However... ...the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner. I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail. That's why Ron and I went looking for him, professor. We'd just found him when he said... - Yes, Miss Granger? - When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris. - Innocent until proven guilty, Severus. - My cat has been Petrified. - I want to see some punishment! - We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime... ...I strongly recommend caution... ...to all. - It's a bit strange, isn't it? - Strange? You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear... ...and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange. Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean? Are you mad? No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign. She's right, you know. Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals... ...into water goblets. Like so. <i>One, two, three. Vera Verto.</i> Now it's your turn. Who would like to go first? <i>Mr. Weasley. ""One, two, three. Vera Verto. ""</i> <i>Vera Verto!</i> That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. - Yes, Miss Granger? - Professor... ...I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets. Very well. You all know, of course... ...that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago... ...by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff... ...Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. - One did not. - Three guesses who. Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective... ...about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, pure-bloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend... ...Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle... ...known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it... ...until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school. The Heir alone... ...would be able to open the Chamber... ...and unleash the horror within, and by so doing... ...purge the school of all those who... ...in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic. Muggle-borns. Naturally, the school has been searched many times. No such chamber has been found. Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber? The Chamber is said to be home to something... ...that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home... ...of a monster. Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets? Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are. If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means... The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it? Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum? - Lf you're talking about Malfoy... - Of course. You heard him. ""You'll be next, Mudbloods. "" I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin? Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries. Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling. Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules... ...and it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous. Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion. ""Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker... ...to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another. "" You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle? - Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything. - Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. - How long will it take to make? - A month. A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin... ...he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then. I know. But it's the only plan we've got. Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30. Yeah! Yeah! All right there, Scarhead? Watch yourself, Harry! Wood, look out! Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger. That's been tampered with, that has. I'll stop it. No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry. Training for the ballet, Potter? You'll never catch me, Potter. Let's go. <i>Harry Potter has caught the Snitch. Gryffindor wins!</i> <i>Finite Incantatem!</i> - Thank you. - Are you okay? No. I think my arm is broken. Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straightaway. - Not you. - Boy doesn't know what he's saying. This won't hurt a bit. <i>Brackium Emendo!</i> Yes, well, that can sometimes happen... ...but the point is... ...you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken. Broken? There's no bones left. Much more flexible, though. Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss. You can go. Out of my way. Should have been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back... You will be able to, won't you? I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business. What do you expect? Pumpkin juice? <i>Kill.</i> <i>Kill.</i> <i>Time to kill.</i> Hello. Dobby? Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby. Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train. It was you. You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through. Indeed. Yes, sir. - You nearly got Ron and me expelled. - At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home. Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see... Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me? Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands. You better clear off before my bones come back, or I might strangle you. Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home. I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me? Not kill you, sir. Never kill you. Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed... ...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin. Why do you wear that thing, Dobby? This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elf's enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here... ...now that history is to repeat itself. Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before? I shouldn't have said that. - Bad Dobby! Bad! - Stop it! Stop it, Dobby! Tell me. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now? Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe. No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it? Put him here. - What happened? - There's been another attack. I think he's been Petrified, Madam Pomfrey. Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker. What can this mean, Albus? It means... ...that our students are in great danger. - What should I tell the staff? - The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again. Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before? Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. - Now he's taught Draco how to do it. - Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure. Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight... ...in the middle of the girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught? No. No one ever comes in here. - Why? - Moaning Myrtle. Who? Moaning Myrtle. - Who's Moaning Myrtle? - I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't expect you to know me. Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable... ...moping Moaning Myrtle? She's a little sensitive. Gather round! Gather round. Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent. In light of the dark events of recent weeks... ...Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club... ...to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves... ...as I myself have done on countless occasions. For full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant... ...Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration. I don't want any of you youngsters to worry. You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear. One. Two. <i>- Three! - Expelliarmus!</i> - Do you think he's all right? - Who cares? An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape... ...but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy. Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students... ...to block unfriendly spells, professor. An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Let's have a volunteer pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you? Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps? - Good luck, Potter. - Thank you, sir. Wands at the ready. - Scared, Potter? - You wish. On the count of three... ...cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm. We don't want any accidents here. One. <i>- Two. - Everte Statum!</i> <i>Rictusempra!</i> I said disarm only. <i>Serpensortia!</i> Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you. <i>Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte Ascendare!</i> <i>Vipera Evanesca.</i> What are you playing at? You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us? - I'm a what? - You can talk to snakes. I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it. No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad. What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin... - That's what you said to it. - You were there. You heard me. I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language. I spoke a different language? But I didn't realize... How can I speak a language without knowing I can? I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too. Exactly. Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson. But I'm not. I can't be. He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know, you could be. I'll see you back in the common room. <i>I want blood.</i> <i>They all must die.</i> <i>Kill.</i> <i>Kill.</i> <i>Kill.</i> <i>Time to kill.</i> Caught in the act. I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words. No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand... Professor... ...I swear I didn't. This is out of my hands, Potter. Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet Lemon. Professor Dumbledore? Bee in your bonnet, Potter? I was just wondering if you put me in the right house. Yes. You were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said last year. You would have done well in Slytherin. You're wrong. Harry? Professor. Your bird... There was nothing I could do. - He just caught fire. - And about time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die... ...and then they are... ...reborn from the ashes. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads. Their tears have healing powers. Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry. I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic. Relax. I do not believe... ...that Harry attacked anyone. - Of course you don't. Right. Well, I'II... - I'll just wait outside, then. - Yes. - You don't think it was me, professor? - No, Harry. I do not think it was you. But I must ask you... ...is there something you wish to tell me? No, sir. Nothing. Very well, then. Off you go. Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into. Crabbe and Goyle. We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle... ...can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy. - How? - I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep... ...hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs... ...and put on their uniforms. - Whose hair are you ripping out, then? - I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin. I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these. Ron, maybe I should do it. Yeah. Right. <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i> Cool. How thick could you get? Come on, let's get them. We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves. Add the hairs. Essence of Crabbe. Cheers. I think I'm gonna be sick. Me too. Harry? Ron. Bloody hell! We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe. - Bloody hell. - Excellent. - But where's Hermione? - I... I don't think I'm going. You go on without me. Hermione, are you okay? Just go. You're wasting time. Come on. I think the Slytherin common room's this way. Excuse me. What are you doing d...? I mean, what are you doing down here? I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night. What are your names again? - I'm... - Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses? - Reading. - Reading? I didn't know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley? Mind your attitude, Malfoy. Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe? Stomachache. <i>I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.</i> I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing... ...that ever happened to this place. - You're wrong! What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore? Well? Do you? Harry Potter? Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin? But then you must have some idea who's behind it all. You know I don't, Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it. Only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me... ...I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting very odd. It's his stomachache. Calm down. Scar. Hair. Hey! Where are you going? That was close. Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you. Go away. Wait till you see. It's awful. Hermione? Are you okay? Do you remember me telling you... ...that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face. Look at your tail. Have you spoken to Hermione? She should be out of hospital in a few days... ...when she stops coughing up fur balls. What's this? Yuck! Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom. - Come to throw something else at me? - Why would I throw something at you? Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business... ...and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me. But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you. Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it. Ten points if you get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head! - But who threw it at you, anyway? - I don't know. I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death... ...and it fell through the top of my head. ""Tom Marvolo Riddle. "" My name... ...is Harry... ...Potter. Do you know anything... ...about the Chamber of Secrets? Can you... ...tell me? Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle? Hello, can you hear me? Riddle! Come. Professor Dumbledore. Dumbledore? It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom. Yes, professor. I suppose I... I had to see for myself if the rumors were true. I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true. About the school as well? I don't have a home to go to. They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, professor? I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid... ...Headmaster Dippet may have no choice. Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught... Is there something... ...you wish to tell me? No, sir. Nothing. Very well, then. Off you go. Good night, sir. - Let's get you out of there. - Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone... You can't. You don't understand. The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do... ...is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered. It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one. Never. Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. - Now, stand aside. - No! - Stand aside, Hagrid. - No! <i>Cistem Aperio!</i> <i>Arania Exumai!</i> Aragog! Aragog! I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled. Hagrid! It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago. It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be. We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch. The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done? Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it? That would be a cheerful visit. ""Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"" Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you? No. What's that you've got, Hagrid? It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, you know. Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing to do. But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them... ...and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three... ...had best be looking after yourselves. All right? Hello, Neville. Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come. Come on! It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless it wasn't a student. Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something. And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone. All right, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter. Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them... ...if they fly anywhere near him. - Well, that too. Professor McGonagall. - This match has been canceled. - We can't cancel Quidditch. Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see. I warn you. This could be a wee bit of a shock. Hermione! She was found near the library... ...along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you? No. Could I have your attention, please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately: ""All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions. "" I should tell you this: Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught... ...it is likely the school will be closed. We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him... ...but if he did set the monster loose last time... ...he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start. But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class. I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again. Who's there? Hello? Hello? - What's that for? - Nothing. I was expecting... It doesn't matter. Come on in. I just made a pot of tea. Hagrid, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm all right. Did you hear about Hermione? Yeah. I heard about that, all right. Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets? What you had to understand about that is... Quick, under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both of you. - Professor Dumbledore, sir. - Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we...? Of course. Come in. Come in. That's Dad's boss. Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic. Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business. Had to come. Three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. - The Ministry's got to act. - But I never... You know I never, professor. I want it understood, Cornelius... ...that Hagrid... ...has my full confidence. Albus, look, Hagrid's record is against him. - I've got to take him. - Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban prison. I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid. Already here, Fudge? Good. What are you doing here? Get out of my house! Believe me... ...I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your... You call this a house? No. I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here. Well, what exactly is it that you want with me? The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all 12 signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks... ...there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school. You can't take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance. You mark my words, there'll be killings next! You think so? Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal... ...I will, of course, step aside. However... ...you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts... ...to those who... ...ask for it. Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge. Come, Hagrid. Well? Lf... If anybody was looking for some stuff... ...then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yep. That would lead them right. That's all I have to say. And someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away. Good boy. Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day. Look. Come on. Come on, Fang. Come on. What? You heard what Hagrid said. ""Follow the spiders. "" They're heading to the Dark Forest. Why spiders? Why couldn't it be ""follow the butterflies""? Harry, I don't like this. - Harry, I don't like this at all. - Shush! Can we go back now? Come on. Who is it? Don't panic. Hagrid? Is that you? We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? You're Aragog, aren't you? Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before. He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. That's a lie. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. - Then you're not the monster? - No. The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler. Harry. But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago? We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. But have you seen it? I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here. - Harry! - What? Well, thank you. We'll just go. Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat... ...when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friend of Hagrid. Can we panic now? Know any spells? One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them. Where's Hermione when you need her? Let's go! <i>Arania Exumai!</i> Go! Glad we're out of there. <i>Arania Exumai!</i> - Thanks for that. - Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on, move faster! Come on! Go! Get us in the air. The flying gear's jammed! - Come on! Pull! - I'm trying! Follow the spiders. Follow the spiders. If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him. I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? - What have we found out? - We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent. Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever. - What's that? - Ron... This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. Come on. ""Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land... ...none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years... ...instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it. "" Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake. But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead? Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it. But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again. And Hermione had the mirror. I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along. And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry. The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. ""Spiders flee before it. "" - It all fits. - How's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty, great snake. Someone would have seen it. - Hermione's answered that too. - Pipes? It's using the plumbing. Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left? Moaning Myrtle. <i>All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.</i> <i>All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.</i> As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts. So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed? A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last. - My moment? - Weren't you saying just last night... ...that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is? That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. - Your skills, after all, are legend. - Very well. I'll just be in my office getting... Getting ready. Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva? Ginny Weasley. ""Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. "" Ginny. Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know. Professor, we have some information for you. Are you going somewhere? Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Got to go. - What about my sister? - Well... As to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I. You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can't go now. I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description... You're running away? - After all you did in your books? - Books can be misleading. - You wrote them. - My dear boy, use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think I'd done those things. You're a fraud. You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done. Is there anything you can do? Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. I'd never have sold another book. In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you. Don't even think about it. Who's there? Hello, Harry. - What do you want? - To ask you how you died. It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. - Who was it, Myrtle? - I don't know. I was distraught! But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language. And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and... ...I died. - Just like that? How? I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes... ...over there by that sink. This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue. Excellent, Harry. Good work. Well, then, I'll just be... There's no need for me to stay. Yes, there is. - You first. - Now, boys, what good will it do? Better you than us. But... Obviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? It's really quite filthy down here. - All right. Let's go. - Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. Thanks, Myrtle. Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway. Go on. This way. - What's this? - It looks like a snake. - It's a snakeskin. - Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more. Heart of a lion, this one. The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds... ...at the sight of her mangled body. So... You first, Mr. Potter. Say goodbye to your memories. <i>Obliviate!</i> - Ron! Ron, are you okay? - I'm fine. Hello. Who are you? - Ron Weasley. - Really? And who am I? Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is. It's an odd sort of place, isn't it? Do you live here? - No. - Really? - What do I do now? - You wait here... ...and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. - I'll go on and find Ginny. - Okay. Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up, wake up. Please wake up. She won't wake. Tom. Tom Riddle. What do you mean, she won't wake? - She's not...? - She's still alive, but only just. - Are you a ghost? - A memory... ...preserved in a diary for 50 years. She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk. It won't come until it's called. - Give me my wand, Tom. - You won't be needing it. - We've got to go. We've got to save her. - I'm afraid I can't do that. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets. No. She couldn't. She wouldn't. It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat... ...Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. - But why? - Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. And then who should find it but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet. And why did you want to meet me? I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid... ...to gain your trust. - Hagrid's my friend. - And you framed him, didn't you? - It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent. I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you. He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was at school... ...so I decided to leave behind a diary... ...preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages... ...so that one day I would be able to lead another... ...to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work. Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready. And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again. Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target has been you. How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent... ...was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar... ...while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed? Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time. Voldemort is my past, present and future. You. You're the Heir of Slytherin. - You're Voldemort. - Surely you didn't think... ...I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere... ...would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world. Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world. Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me. He'll never be gone. Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him. Fawkes? So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender. A songbird and an old hat. Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin... ...against the famous Harry Potter. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me. No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you. Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete. In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return... ...very much alive. Ginny? Remarkable, isn't it... ...how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do... ...especially in the hands of a silly little girl. What are you doing? Stop. No! It was me. But I swear, I didn't mean to. Riddle made me, and... Harry, you're hurt. Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough. Of course. Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks. It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory. Amazing! This is just like magic! You both realize, of course... ...that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules. Yes, sir. There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled. Yes, sir. Therefore, it is only fitting... ...that you both receive... ...Special Awards for Services to the School. Thanks, sir. Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would... ...have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. I believe we want our gamekeeper back. First, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And... ...second... ...I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry? It's just... You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain... Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me. I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry... ...he transferred some of his powers to you... ...the night he gave you that scar. Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me? Not intentionally... ...but yes. So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be in Slytherin. It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness... ...and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor? - Because I asked it to. - Exactly, Harry. Exactly. Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor... ...then I suggest you look more closely at this. Be careful. Godric Gryffindor. It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat. Dobby. So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys. I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter. So it's true. You have returned. When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter... ...was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. - Ridiculous. - Curiously, Lucius, several of them... ...were under the impression that you would curse their family... ...if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place. - How dare you! - Beg your pardon? My sole concern has always been and will always be... ...the welfare of this school... ...and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume? Yes. And? Who was it? Voldemort. Only this time he chose to act through somebody else... ...by means of this. I see. Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things... ...should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be... ...severe. Well, let us hope... ...that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day. Don't worry. I will be. Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving. Sir? I wonder if I could have that? Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours. Mine? I don't know what you're talking about. I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron... ...that day at Diagon Alley. You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Open it. Dobby. Master has given Dobby a sock. What? I didn't give... Master has presented Dobby with clothes. Dobby is free. You lost me my servant! You shall not harm Harry Potter. Your parents were meddlesome fools too. Mark my words, Potter. One day soon... ...you are going to meet the same sticky end. Harry Potter freed Dobby. How can Dobby ever repay him? - Just promise me something. - Anything, sir. Never try to save my life again. - Welcome back, Sir Nicholas. - Thank you. - Good evening, Sir Nicholas. - Good evening. - Good to see you, Sir Nicholas. - Thank you. Hello. - Hermione! Welcome back. - Thanks, Sir Nicholas. Harry. It's Hermione. - Welcome back, Hermione. - It's good to be back. Congratulations. I can't believe you solved it. We had loads of help from you. - We couldn't have done it without you. - Thanks. Could I have your attention, please? Before we begin the feast... ...let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey... ...whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered... ...to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events... ...as a school treat... ...all exams have been canceled. <i>Oh, no.</i> Sorry I'm late. The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron... ...and Hermione, of course... ...I would still be you-know-where... ...so I'd just like to say thanks. There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.",0.751003086566925,0.8231570720672607,0.24939872324466705,0.3426327407360077,0.2040420100092888,0.43809035420417786
3 Harry,"Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima! Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry. Harry. Harry, open the door. Marge. How lovely to see... Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form. What is it? Nothing. School stuff. Later perhaps, if you behave. I will if she does. - Oh, you're still here, are you? - Yes. Don't say yes in that ungrateful way. Damn good of my brother to keep you. He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh? Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up. Take Marge's suitcase upstairs. Okay. Finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh. - Can I tempt you, Marge? - Just a small one. Excellent nosh, Petunia. A bit more. Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs. Just a bit more. That's a boy. You wanna try a little drop of brandy? A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh? What are you smirking at? Where did you send the boy, Vernon? St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases. Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times. Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby... ...wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia? Nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed. - And a drunk too, no doubt? - That's a lie. - What did you say? - My dad wasn't a drunk. Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip. I think it's time you went to bed. Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up. Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup. Shut up! Shut up! Right. Let me tell you... Vernon! Vernon! Vernon, do something! Stop! I've got you, Marge. I've got you. - Hold on, hold on. - Get off. - Don't you dare! - Sorry. Oh, Vernon. Oh, God. Marge! Please! Marge! Come back! You bring her back! You bring her back now. - You put her right! - No. She deserved what she got. - Keep away from me. - You can't do magic outside school. - Yeah? Try me. - They won't let you back now. You've nowhere to go. I don't care. Anywhere is better than here. ""Welcome to the Knight Bus... ...emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. "" What you doing down there? - I fell over. - What you fall over for? - I didn't do it on purpose. - Well, come on, then. Let's not wait for the grass to grow. - What you looking at? - Nothing. Well, come on, then. In. No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in. Come on. Come on. Move on, move on. - Take her away, Ern. - Yeah, take it away, Ernie. It's going to be a bumpy ride. - What did you say your name was? - I didn't. - Whereabouts are you headed? - The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London. You hear that? ""The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London. "" The Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup... ...make sure you eat it before it eats you. - But the Muggles. Can't they see us? - Muggles? They don't see nothing, do they? No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel. Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock! Ten, nine, eight... ...seven, six, five... ...four, three, three and a half... ...two, one and three quarters. Yes! Who is that? That man. Who is that? Who is...? That is Sirius Black, that is. Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black. He's a murderer. Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it. - How did he escape? - Well, that's the question, isn't it? He's the first one that done it. He was a big supporter of... ...You-Know-Who. I reckon you've heard of him. Yeah. Him I've heard of. Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock. They're getting closer, Ernie. Ernie, they're right on top of us! Mind your head. Hey, guys? Guys? Why the long faces? Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there. - The Leaky Cauldron. - Next stop, Knockturn Alley. Mr. Potter, at last. - Take it away, Ern. - Yeah, take it away, Ernie! Room 11. Hedwig. Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter. He arrived here just five minutes before yourself. As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter... ...earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... ...a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So that's that... ...and no harm done. Pea soup? No, thank you. - Minister? - Yes? - I don't understand. - Understand? I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home. Come now. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban... ...for blowing up their aunts. On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things... ...was very, very irresponsible. - ""The state of things,"" sir? - We have a killer on the loose. Sirius Black, you mean? But what's he got to do with me? Nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty... ...of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room. Hedwig. Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't... ...wander. Right! You gonna move that bus or what? Housekeeping. I'll come back later. I'm warning you, Hermione. Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy. It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect? - It's in his nature. - A cat? Is that what they told you? - Looks like a pig with hair. - That's rich... ...coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy. Harry. Harry. - Egypt. What's it like? - Brilliant. Loads of old stuff... ...like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself. - Egyptians used to worship cats. - Along with the dung beetle. - Not flashing that clipping again? - I haven't shown anyone. No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. - The day maid. - Night maid. - Cook. - The bloke who fixed the toilet. - Harry. - Mrs. Weasley. - Good to see you, dear. - Good to see you. - Got everything? - Yes. - Yes? All your books? - It's all upstairs. - Your clothes? - Everything. - Good boy. - Thank you. - Harry Potter. - Mr. Weasley. - Harry, wonder if I might have a word? - Yeah, sure. - Hermione. - Good morning, Mr. Weasley. - Looking forward to a new term? - Yeah. It should be great. Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me... ...from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. But I think that you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger. Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir? What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry? - Only that he's escaped from Azkaban. - Do you know why? Thirteen years ago, when you stopped... - Voldemort. - Don't say his name. Sorry. When you stopped You-Know-Who... ...Black lost everything. But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant. And in his mind... ...you are the only thing that stands in the way... ...of You-Know-Who returning to power. And that is why... ...he has escaped from Azkaban. To find you. And kill me. Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear... ...you won't go looking for Black. Mr. Weasley... ...why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me? Quick. Quick. Ron, Ron! Oh, for goodness' sake! Don't lose him! I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... - I lost control. - Brilliant. Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled. I was lucky not to be arrested. I still think it was brilliant. Come on. Everywhere else is full. Who do you think that is? - Professor R.J. Lupin. - Do you know everything? How is it she knows everything? - It's on his suitcase, Ronald. - Oh. - Do you think he's really asleep? - Seems to be. Why? I gotta tell you something. Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban... ...to come after you? - Yeah. But they'll catch Black, won't they? - I mean, everyone's looking for him. - Sure. Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... ...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic. - Thanks, Ron. Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet. What's going on? I don't know. Maybe we've broken down. Ouch, Ron. That was my foot. There's something moving out there. I think someone's coming aboard. Bloody hell! What's happening? Harry. Harry, are you all right? Thank you. Here, eat this. It'll help. It's all right. It's chocolate. What was that thing that came? It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was searching the train for Sirius Black. If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better. What happened to me? Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something. And did either of you two... ...you know... ...pass out? - No. I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again. But someone was screaming. A woman. No one was screaming, Harry. Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts. Now, I'd like to say a few words... ...before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... ...who's kindly consented to fill the post... ...of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, professor. Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry. Potter. Is it true you fainted? - I mean, you actually fainted? - Shove off, Malfoy. - How did he find out? - Just forget it. Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... ...has decided to retire... ...in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... ...that his place will be taken by none other... ...than our own Rubeus Hagrid. Finally, on a more disquieting note... ...at the request of the Ministry of Magic... ...Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... ...until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now whilst I've been assured... ...that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... ...a word of caution. Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... ...between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... ...to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know, happiness can be found... ...even in the darkest of times... ...if one only remembers to turn on the light. <i>Fortuna Major.</i> Here, listen. She just won't let me in. <i>- Fortuna Major. - No, no. Wait, wait.</i> Watch this. <i>- Amazing. Just with my voice. - Fortuna Major.</i> - Yes, all right. Go in. - Thank you. Still doing that after three years. - She can't even sing. - Exactly. - Hey, man. - Hey, man. - Oh, God. - That's awful. Green. That's a monkey. - What is that? - You call that a monkey? Do not give him one again. Hey, Neville, try an elephant. - Ron, catch. - I will. I think we have a winner. - Oh, don't try one of them. - Oh, no. Look at him. His face. <i>Welcome, my children.</i> In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight. Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together we shall cast ourselves into the future. This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves. So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. What do you see? The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. - First, you must look beyond. - What a load of rubbish. - Where did you come from? - Me? - I've been here all this time. - You, boy... Is your grandmother quite well? I think so. I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. Pity. Broaden your minds. Your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond? - I think you are. - Sure. Look at the cup. Tell me what you see. Yeah. Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. So... ...you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it. Give me the cup. Oh, my dear boy. My dear... ...you have the Grim. The Grin? What's the Grin? Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim. ""Taking form of a giant spectral dog. It's among the darkest omens in our world. It's an omen... ...of death. "" You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black? Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject. Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking? A fair few. Hang on. That's not possible. Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. You have to be in two classes at once. Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once? ""Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future. "" That's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind. I got a real treat for you today. A great lesson. So follow me. Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there. And open your books to page 49. Exactly how do we do that? Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me. - Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom. - I'm okay. Okay. - I think they're funny. - Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes. Shut up, Malfoy. Dementor! Dementor! - Just ignore him. - You're supposed to stroke it. Yeah. Isn't he beautiful? Say hello to Buckbeak. Hagrid, exactly what is that? That, Ron, is a hippogriff. First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may be the last thing you ever do. Now, who'd like to come and say hello? Well done, Harry. Well done. Come on now. Now... ...you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... ...step up. Give him a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. If he does, you can go and touch him. If not... Well, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low. Back off, Harry. Back off. Keep still. Keep still. Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you. Right. I think you can go and pat him now. Go on. Don't be shy. Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... Nice and slow. Now let him come to you. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... That's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry, well done! Does he get to fly? - I think he may let you ride him now. - What? - Come on. - Hey, hey, hey! Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak. That was wicked, Harry! Oh, please. Well done, well done. - How am I doing me first day? - Brilliant, professor. You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute! Malfoy, no... No! Buckbeak! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Whoa! Buckbeak! Away, you silly creature... - It's killed me! - Calm down. It's just a scratch! Hagrid! - He has to be taken to the hospital. - I'm the teacher. I'll do it. - You're gonna regret this. - Class dismissed! You and your bloody chicken! Does it hurt terribly, Draco? It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky. Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm. - I can't do homework for weeks. - Listen to the idiot. - He's really laying it on thick, isn't he? - At least Hagrid didn't get fired. I hear Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this. - He's been sighted! - Who? Sirius Black! Dufftown? That's not far from here. You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? - With dementors at every entrance? - Dementors? He slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again? That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands. Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess... ...as to what is inside? - That's a boggart, that is. - Very good, Mr. Thomas. Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like? - No one knows. - When did she get here? Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most. - That's what makes them so... - So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. Let's practice it now. Without wands, please. <i>After me. Riddikulus!</i> <i>- Riddikulus! - Very good.</i> A little louder and very clear. Listen: <i>- Riddikulus! - Riddikulus!</i> - This class is ridiculous. - Very good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a boggart is laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please? Come on, don't be shy. Come on. Come on. Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all? Professor Snape. - Sorry? - Professor Snape. Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all. - You live with your grandmother. - I don't want it to turn into her, either. No... ...it won't. I want you to picture her clothes. Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind. - She carries a red handbag... - We don't need to hear. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe... ...here's what I want you to do. Excuse me. Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes. Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One, two, three. Think, Neville, think. <i>Riddikulus!</i> Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay... ...to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line... Form a line! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... ...and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron! Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave! Wand at the ready, Ron. <i>Riddikulus!</i> Yes! You see? Very good, very good! Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next! Show us what you see. Keep your nerve. Steady. <i>Riddikulus!</i> And next! Step up, step up! Wonderful, wonderful! Here! <i>Riddikulus!</i> Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today. Collect your books from the back. That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry! Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing. Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school... ...that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting the village. That's the rule, Potter. Those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put. I thought if you signed it, then I could... I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word. Forget about it, guys. See you later. Professor, can I ask you something? You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes? I thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train... ...and the dementor. - I'm very impressed. That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise. Before I fainted... ...I heard something. A woman... ...screaming. Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power. I think it was my mother... ...the night she was murdered. The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... ...she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... ...even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. And your father, James, on the other hand... ...he... He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time, you'll come to see just how much. Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack. - You heard it's the most... - Haunted building in Britain. I know. What's going on? Probably Neville forgot the password again. - Hey. - Oh, you're there. Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy! Get back, all of you. No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched. The Fat Lady! She's gone! Serves her right. She was a terrible singer. It's not funny, Ron. Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room. - Be quiet. - Make way. - The headmaster's here. - Come on, move. You heard. Move! Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady. There's no need for ghosts, professor. The Fat Lady's there. Mind where you're going! Slow down! You listen! I'm Head Boy! - Come back here! - Keep moving! Dear lady, who did this to you? Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name. It's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about. He's here, somewhere in the castle! Sirius Black! Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall. I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. There's nothing there. - Thank you. - The third floor's clear too, sir. - Very good. - I've done the dungeons. No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle. I didn't really expect him to linger. Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... ...completely undetected? - Quite remarkable, yes. Any theories on how he managed it? Many. Each as unlikely as the next. You may recall... ...prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... ...about your appointment of Professor... Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... ...and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses. What about Potter? Should he be warned? Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep. For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud. Turn to page 394. Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin? That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... ...at the present time. Turn to page 394. ""Werewolves""? Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. - We're not meant to start that for weeks. - Quiet. When did she come in? Did you see her come in? Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... ...between an Animagus and a werewolf? No one? - How disappointing. - Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon... ...he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend. The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind. Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time... ...you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself... ...or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all? - He's got a point, you know. - Five points from Gryffindor. As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning... ...two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... ...on recognizing it. - It's Quidditch tomorrow. Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page 394. The term ""werewolf""... <i>...is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word ""wer""...</i> ...which means ""man, "" and ""wolf. "" Werewolf, man-wolf. There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape-shifting... ...being bitten by a werewolf... Go, Harry! Go, Harry! <i>Aresto momentum!</i> - He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? - Peaky? What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet. Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like. Probably a right sight better than he normally does. - How are you feeling? - Oh, brilliant. You gave us a right good scare. - What happened? - Well, you fell off your broom. Really? I meant the match. Who won? No one blames you, Harry. Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. After he saved you, he sent them off. There's something else you should know too. When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... Well... <i>I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.</i> Is there no chance of fixing it? No. Professor, why do the dementors affect me so? - I mean, more than everyone else? - Listen. Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... ...until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry. Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of. - I'm scared, professor. - I'd consider you a fool if you weren't. I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made the one on the train go away. There was only one that night. - But you made it go away. - I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you... ...perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest. Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now! - Guys, let me go. - Clever, Harry. - But not clever enough. - We've got a better way. - I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade. - We know. We'll get you there. - We'll show you a quicker way. - Lf you pipe down. - Bless him. - Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't... - Now, Harry. - Come and join the big boys. What are you doing?! - What's this rubbish? - ""What's this rubbish?"" he says. - It's the secret to our success. - It's a wrench giving it to you... But we've decided your needs are greater than ours. George, if you will. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. ""Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... ...are proud to present the Marauder's Map. "" We owe them so much. Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... - No. Is that really...? - Dumbledore. - In his study. - Pacing. Does that a lot. - So this map shows... - Everyone. - Where they are. - What they're doing. - Every minute. - Every day. - Brilliant! Where did you get it? - From Filch's office. - First year. - There are seven secret passageways... ...out of the castle. - We'd recommend this one. - The One-Eyed Witch passageway. - Leads you to Honeyduke's. Hurry. Filch is heading this way. And don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say: ""Mischief managed. "" Otherwise, anyone can read it. Now, how much do you want? Delicious. It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that? Twice. Do you want to move a bit closer? To the Shrieking Shack? Actually, I'm fine here. Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your new dream home? Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in one room? - Shut your mouth, Malfoy. - Not very friendly. Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors. - Hope you don't mean yourself. - How dare you talk to me! You filthy little mudblood! Who is that? - Don't stand there! Do something! - What? What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis? Get out of the way! Move! Malfoy! Wait! Wait! Harry! Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny. Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map. He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall. - Aren't you? - Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak. Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. - Ron fancies her. - That's not true! - Professor McGonagall! - Cornelius! Allow me, minister. - Oh, Hagrid... - Sorry about that. Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good. It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors... ...into my pub every other night! - We have... - We have a killer on the loose. - Sirius Black in Hogsmeade! And what would bring him here? - Harry Potter. - Harry Potter? Come. Harry! - No underage wizards allowed in today! - Shut the damn door! - So rude. - Thick heads. - Thick heads?! - How dare they! - Who are they calling thick heads? - Young whippersnappers! Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits. Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place. Tell me what this is all about. Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... Remember? They hid. Few knew where they were. One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who. Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night... ...he also killed Peter Pettigrew! - Peter Pettigrew? - Little lump of a boy. - Always trailing after Black. - I remember. Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. - What happened? - Peter tried to warn the Potters... ...and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black. Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him! A finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters... ...but he's the reason they're dead. - He wants to finish things. - I don't believe it. - That's not the worst of it. - What could be worse? - This: Sirius Black was... ...and remains to this day... ...Harry Potter's godfather! Ron, look! - Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. - Merry Christmas. Harry, what happened? He was their friend... ...and he betrayed them. He was their friend! I hope he finds me. Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him! <i>Harry.</i> <i>There you are. You came.</i> Are you sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic... ...well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level. I'm sure. Well, everything's prepared. The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Did you ever hear of it? No? Well... A Patronus is a positive force. For the wizard who conjures one... ...it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory. Can you do this? Yes. Very well. Close your eyes. Concentrate. Explore your past. Do you have a memory? Allow it to fill you up. Lose yourself within it. <i>Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.</i> <i>- Expecto Patronum. - Very good.</i> Shall we? Wand at the ready. <i>Expecto Patronum!</i> <i>Expecto... Expecto...</i> <i>Expect...</i> Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths. It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time. That would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better. - That's one nasty dementor. - Oh, no, no, no. That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? - Which memory did you choose? - The first time I rode a broom. That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough. There's another. It's not happy, exactly. Well, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt... ...but it's complicated. - Is it strong? Then let's give it a try. You feel ready? Just do it. <i>Expecto Patronum!</i> <i>Expecto Patronum!</i> Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done! - I think I've had enough for today. - Yes. Sit down. Here. Eat this, it helps. It really helps. And just so you know, Harry... ...I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... ...is saying something. I was thinking of him. And Mum. Seeing their faces. They were talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real. But it's the best I have. - Beautiful day. - Gorgeous. Unless you've been ripped to pieces! Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about? - Ronald has lost his rat. - I haven't lost anything! - Your cat killed him! - Rubbish. Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... ...is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone. Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets! - Your cat killed him! - Did not. - Did. - Didn't. How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing? Well, first off, the committee members took turns... ...talking about why we were there. I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak... ...was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine. He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... ...who would kill you as soon as look at you. And then? And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius. - They're not sacking you! - No, I'm not sacked. Buckbeak's been sentenced to death! Spiders! There's... There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance. - I don't wanna tap-dance! - Tell those spiders. Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them... <i>- Peter Pettigrew? - Little lump of a boy.</i> - Always trailing after Sirius Black. - Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him! - Put that light out! - Sorry. - Watch it there, boy. - We're trying to sleep here! <i>Mischief managed. Nox.</i> Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night? I was sleepwalking. How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle. My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand. Turn out your pockets. Turn out your pockets! What's this? - Spare bit of parchment. - Really? Open it. Reveal your secrets. Read it. ""Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... ...offer their compliments to Professor Snape and... "" Go on. ""And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business. "" - You insolent little... - Professor! Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we? Harry, are you all right? That remains to be seen. I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. - Clearly, it's full of dark magic. - I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone... ...who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night. Are you deaf? Put that light out! Come in. I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... ...but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black... ...is a map to you? - No. - No, sir. Your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected... ...with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again. - Do you hear me? - Yes, sir. I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know. Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead. Oh, really? And who might that be? Peter Pettigrew. That's not possible. It's just what I saw. Good night, professor. Broaden your minds. You must look beyond. The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. Only then can you see. Try again. Now, what do we have here? Do you mind me trying? The Grim, possibly. My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class... ...I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit... ...for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there. You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled... ...as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books... ...to which you so desperately cleave. Have I said something? She's gone mental, Hermione has. Not that she wasn't always mental... ...but now it's in the open for everyone to see. Hang on. - We better take this back. - I'm not going back. - Fine. See you later. - See you. <i>Harry Potter...</i> - Professor Trelawney... - He will return tonight. Sorry? Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder... ...shall break free. Innocent blood shall be spilt... ...and servant and master shall be reunited once more. I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something? No. Nothing. I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible. - It just got worse. - What did I say? Father said... ...I can keep the hippogriff's head. I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room. This is going to be rich. - Look who's here. - Come to see the show? You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! Hermione, no! He's not worth it. Malfoy, are you okay? - Let's go. Quick. - Not a word to anyone, understood? - That felt good. - Not good, brilliant. Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them. Why don't we just set him free? They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore... ...would get into trouble. He's coming down, Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... When it happens. Great man, Dumbledore. A great man. - We'll stay with you too. - You'll do no such thing! Think I want you seeing something like that? No. You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron... Scabbers! You're alive! - Keep a closer eye on your pet. - I think you owe someone an apology. Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know. I meant me! Blimey. What was that? Hagrid! Oh, crikey. No, minister. Over this way. It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment! Quick. Quick! Hagrid. - It'll be fine. It'll be okay. - Go on, go on! - That's ling you see over there... - On the slope. - On the slope... Ah, Hagrid. - Professor Dumbledore. - Good evening. - Minister. Make your way through. - Have a tea, if you like. - No, Hagrid. - Gentlemen. - I'd like a cup of tea. Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal... ...of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak... ...hereinafter called ""the condemned,"" shall be executed this day at sundown. - Dear, dear... - Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. - All right. It'll be all right. - The execution shall dispatch... What? I thought I just saw... - Never mind. - Let's go! Buckbeak didn't mean no harm. Oh, no. He bit me. Scabbers. Ron. Ron! - Ron! - Scabbers, come back. Wait! - Scabbers, you bit me! - Harry, you do realize what tree this is? That's not good. Ron, run! Harry, Hermione, run! It's the Grim! - Harry! - Ron! Ron, wait! Harry! - Help! - Ron! - Ron. Ron. - Ron! Come on! Move! Duck! Harry! - Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't worry. - Where do you suppose this goes? - I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong. We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we? Come on. Ron. - Ron. You're okay. - The dog. Where is it? It's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus. If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too! No. Only one will die tonight. Then it'll be you! Are you going to kill me, Harry? <i>Expelliarmus!</i> Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we? Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within. Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you? - I found him. - I know. - It's him. - I understand. - Let's kill him! - No! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes. How long have you known? - Since Professor Snape set the essay. - Well, Hermione. You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met. Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him! - Wait! - I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban! Very well. Kill him. But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why. I know why. You betrayed my parents. - You're the reason they're dead! - No, it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents... ...somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead! - Who was it, then? - Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room! Right now! Come out, come out, Peter! <i>- Come out, come out and play! - Expelliarmus!</i> Vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you. Severus... I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof. Brilliant, Snape. You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion. If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business... ...to attend to. - Give me a reason. I beg you! - Don't be a fool. - He can't help it. It's habit. - Be quiet. - Be quiet yourself! You two, quarrelling like an old married couple. Run along and play with your chemistry set! I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best. Severus, please. After you. <i>Expelliarmus!</i> - Harry! What did you just do? - You attacked a teacher! - Tell me about Peter. - He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend! - No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him! - No, he didn't. I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map! - The map was lying, then. - The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there! - Me?! He's mental! - Not you! Your rat! - Scabbers has been in my family for... - Twelve years? Curiously long life for a common garden rat! - He's missing a toe, isn't he? - So what? - All they could find of Pettigrew was his... - Finger! Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! - And then he transformed into a rat! - Show me. - Give it to him, Ron. - What are you trying to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing? Remus? Sirius. My old friends! Harry! Look at you. You look so much like your father. - James. We were the best of friends... - How dare you speak to Harry! How dare you talk about James in front of him! - You sold James and Lily to Voldemort! - I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done? - What would you have done? - Died, rather than betray my friends! James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad would have spared me! He would have shown me mercy! Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Together! No! - Harry, this man... - I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle. - Bless you, boy. Bless you! - Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you. Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit. A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off! I was going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder. Okay. - You better go. - No. Don't worry, okay? It's fine. I'll stay. You go, I'll stay. - You okay? - I'm fine. Go. - That looks really painful. - So painful. They might chop it. I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat. It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off. It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it. I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends... ...to become killers. Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free. Turn me into a flobberworm. Anything but the dementors! Ron! Haven't I been a good pet? You won't let them give me... ...to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! - Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't... - Get away from her! I don't know if you know, Harry... ...but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather. I know. I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... ...but if you ever wanted a different home... What? Come and live with you? It's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to. Harry! Remus, my old friend. Have you taken your potion tonight? You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! Here! This flesh is only flesh! <i>Expelliarmus!</i> Harry! Remus! Remus! Run! Run! - Come on. - Wait. Wait. Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea. Professor? Professor Lupin? Nice doggy. Nice doggy! There you are, Potter! Sirius! Come back here, Potter! Sirius! No. Sirius! <i>Expecto Patronum!</i> Harry? I saw my dad. What? He sent the dementors away. I saw him across the lake. Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss. - They're gonna kill him? - No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster, stop them. - They've got the wrong man. - It's true. Sirius is innocent. - It's Scabbers who did it. - Scabbers? He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat. - But then they gave him an owl... - The point is, we know the truth. - Please believe us. - I do, Miss Granger. But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true... ...is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. Mysterious thing, time. Powerful... ...and when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight... ...more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck. What the bloody hell was that all about? Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk... What just happened? - Where's Ron? - 7:30. Where were we at 7:30? I don't know. Going to Hagrid's? Come on. And we can't be seen. Hermione! Hermione! Hermione, wait. Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing? You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! That's us. Hermione, no! He's not worth it. This is not normal. This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year. - You mean we've gone back in time? - Yes. Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly, something happened he wants us to change. Good punch. Thanks. Malfoy's coming. - Run. - Not a word to anyone, understood? I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words. - That felt good. - Not good, brilliant. Come on. We should be at Hagrid's. Look. Buckbeak's still alive. Of course. Remember what Dumbledore said? If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go. Here they come. I'd better hurry. Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free. Scabbers, you're alive! - Keep a closer eye on your pet. - That's Pettigrew. - Harry, you can't. - He betrayed my parents. - You don't expect me to sit here. - Yes, and you must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. We can't be seen. Fudge is coming. And we aren't leaving? Why aren't we leaving? Are you mad? That hurt. Sorry. We're coming out the back door. Go! Is that really what my hair looks like from the back? What? I thought I just saw... - Never mind. - Let's go. Okay, go, Harry. Go! Get away. Get off. Minister, I really think I should sign as well. Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be... Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on. Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay? - Your name only. - It's such a very long name... Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret. - Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky. - Here we are, minister. Follow me. - Now, look there. - Where? - Look beyond the rocks. - What am I supposed to see? Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster. - Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed. - And all the strawberries. - Come on, Buckbeak. Come on. - I see no strawberries. - Over there. - Where? - Over there. - This way. - Let's get this over, please. - All right. But where is it? I saw the beast, just now. - Not a moment ago! - How extraordinary. Buckbeak. Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him. - Hagrid? - Buckbeak. I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. How could you? You've been with us all the time. - Right. - Well, well. We must search the grounds. Well, search the skies, if you must, minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you. You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor. - Come on. - This way. This way, now. - Now what? - We save Sirius. - How? - No idea. <i>- Look. It's Lupin. - Immobulus!</i> And Snape's coming. And now we wait. And now we wait. - At least someone's enjoying himself. - Yeah. - Hermione? - Yeah? Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... ...I did see someone. That someone made the dementors go away. With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him... ...only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it. It was my dad. My dad conjured the Patronus. - Harry, but your dad's... - Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw. Here we come. You see Sirius talking to me there? - He's asking me to come live with him. - That's great. When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... ...someplace you can see the sky. He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban. Harry! Run! Let's go. - What are you doing? - Saving your life. Thanks. - Great. Now he's coming for us. - Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run! That was so scary. Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. Sirius. Come on! - This is horrible. - Don't worry. My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. Any minute now. Right there. You'll see. Harry, listen to me. No one's coming. Don't worry, he will. He will come. - Sirius. - You're dying... ...both of you. Harry! <i>Expecto Patronum!</i> You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time because... ...well, I had already done it. - Does that make sense? - No. But I don't like flying...! <i>Bombarda!</i> I'll be forever grateful for this... ...to both of you. - I want to go with you. - One day, perhaps. For some time, my life will be too unpredictable. And besides... ...you're meant to be here. - But you're innocent. And you know it. And for now, that will do. I expect you're tired of hearing this... ...but you look so like your father. Except your eyes. - You have... - My mother's eyes. It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little. But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us. And you can always find them... ...in here. You really are the brightest witch of your age. We have to go. - Well? - He's free. We did it. Did what? Good night. How did you get there? I was talking to you there. And now you're there. - What's he talking about, Harry? - I don't know. Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once? Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me. - You've been sacked. - No. No. I resigned, actually. Resigned? Why? Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... ...well, someone like me teaching their children. - But Dumbledore... - He has already... ...risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me are... Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now. Why do you look so miserable, Harry? None of it made any difference. - Pettigrew escaped. - Didn't make any difference? It made all the difference in the world. You uncovered the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything... ...it is of how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher... ...I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... ...mischief managed. Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle. Harry. Wherever did you get it? Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course. - What are you talking about? - Quiet. Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. They made me do it. Did not. - It's a Firebolt. - It's the fastest broom in the world. For me? - But who sent it? - No one knows. This came with it. - Go on, Harry! - Yeah, let's see. How fast is it, Harry? Lumos. <i>I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.</i> Mischief managed. <i>Nox.</i>",0.7136287987232208,0.9086264669895172,0.01891595870256424,0.7001748979091644,0.06566591747105122,0.6614499539136887
4 Harry,"Bloody kids. How fastidious you've become, Wormtail. As I recall, you once called the nearest gutter pipe home. Could it be that the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you? Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... ...perhaps if we were to do it without the boy. No! The boy is everything! It cannot be done without him. And it will be done. Exactly as I said. - I will not disappoint you, my Lord. - Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign. Nagini tells me the old Muggle caretaker... ...is standing just outside the door. Step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting. <i>Avada Kedavra!</i> Harry. Harry! Are you all right? Hermione. Bad dream. - When did you get here? - Just now. You? Last night. Wake up! Wake up, Ronald! Bloody hell. Honestly, get dressed. And don't go back to sleep. Come on, Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready! - Ron, where are we actually going? - Don't know. - Hey, Dad. Where are we going? - Haven't the foggiest. Keep up! Arthur! It's about time, son. Sorry, Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory, everyone. Works with me at the Ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right? Yes, sir. This way. Merlin's beard! You must be Harry Potter. - Yes, sir. - Great, great pleasure. Pleasure to meet you too, sir. Yes, it's just over there. - Shall we? - Oh, yeah. We don't want to be late. Come on. Nearly there now. Get yourself into a good position. Why are they all standing around that manky old boot? - That isn't just any manky old boot. - It's a Portkey. Time to go! What's a Portkey? - Ready! After three. One, two... - Harry! ...three! Let go, kids! - What?! - Let go! I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh? - Total shambles, as per usual. - Thanks. Go on, look at that! Well, kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup! Stay together! Keep up, girls! Look! Come on! Keep up, girls! Blimey! Parting of the ways, I think, old chap. - See you at the match. - See you. - Cedric. - Ced, come on. See you later, Cedric. Home sweet home. What? - Excellent, excellent. - Ginny, look! - All to the bath. - Look. Girls, choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen. We're all hungry. - Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron! - Feet off the table! - Feet off the table! - Feet off the table! I love magic. Get your Quidditch World Cup programs here! Blimey, Dad. How far up are we? Well, put it this way: If it rains... ...you'll be the first to know. Father and I are in the minister's box... ...by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself. Don't boast, Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself, won't you? While you can. Come on up. Take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for. Come on! It's the Irish! There's Troy! - And Mullet! - And Moran! <i>Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!</i> - Here come the Bulgarians! - Yes! Who's that? That, sis, is the best Seeker in the world. <i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i> Krum! Yes! Good evening! As Minister for Magic... ...it gives me great pleasure... ...to welcome each and every one of you... ...to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup! Let the match... ...begin! <i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i> There's no one like Krum. - Krum? - Dumb Krum? He's like a bird, the way he rides the wind. - He's more than an athlete. - Dumb Krum. He's an artist. - I think you're in love, Ron. - Shut up. <i>Viktor, I love you</i> <i>Viktor, I do</i> <i>When we're apart My heart beats only for you</i> Sounds like the Irish have got their pride on. Stop! Stop it! It's not the Irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now! Get out, it's the Death Eaters! Get back to the Portkey, everybody, and stick together! Fred, George! Ginny is your responsibility. Go! Harry! - Keep up, you lot! - Harry! Harry! Harry! <i>Morsmordre!</i> Harry! - Where are you? - Harry! We've been looking for you for ages! Thought we lost you, mate. What is that? <i>Stupefy!</i> Stop! That's my son! - Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right? - We came back for Harry. Which of you conjured it? - Crouch, you can't possi... - Do not lie! You've been discovered at the scene of the crime. - Crime? - Barty! They're just kids. What crime? It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark. What, Voldemort? Those people tonight, in the masks, they're his too, aren't they? - His followers? - Yeah. Death Eaters. - Follow me. - There was a man, before. There! All of you, this way! A man, Harry? Who? I don't know. I didn't see his face. Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley, dears? Packet of Drooble's... ...and a Licorice Wand. On second thought, just the Drooble's. - It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry. - Just the Drooble's. Thanks. Two Pumpkin Pasties, please. Thank you. Anything sweet for you, dear? Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you. Anything from the trolley? This is horrible. How can the Ministry not know who conjured it? Wasn't there any security or...? Loads, according to Dad. That's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses. It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar. I'm fine. You know Sirius will want to hear about this... ...what you saw at the World Cup and the dream. Hedwig. There we go. Clear the runway! Well, there's something you don't see every day. <i>Well, now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement.</i> This castle will not only be your home this year... ...but home to some very special guests as well. You see, Hogwarts has been chosen... Yes, what is it? What is it? Tell them to wait. Tell them to wait. Wait. So Hogwarts has been chosen to host a legendary event: The Triwizard Tournament. - For those of you who do not know... - Brilliant. ...the Triwizard Tournament brings together three schools... ...for a series of magical contests. From each school, a single student is selected to compete. Now let me be clear. If chosen, you stand alone. And trust me when I say... ...these contests are not for the faint-hearted. But more of that later. For now, please join me in welcoming... ...the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic... ...and their headmistress, Madame Maxime. Bloody hell. Blimey. That's one big woman. And now our friends from the north. Please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang... ...and their high master, Igor Karkaroff. Oh, it's Krum! Blimey, it's him! Viktor Krum! Albus. Igor. Professor Dumbly-dorr, my horses have traveled a long way. - They will need attending to. - Don't worry, Madame Maxime. Our gamekeeper, Hagrid, is more than capable of seeing to them. But you know, Monsieur Hagrid... ...they drink only single-malt whiskey. You idiot! Your attention, please! I'd like to say a few words. Eternal glory. That is what awaits the student who wins the Triwizard Tournament. But to do this, that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks. - Wicked. - Wicked. For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this... ...we have the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation... ...Mr. Bartemius Crouch. Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody. - Alastor Moody? The Auror? - Auror? Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are filled thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter, though, these days. - My dear old friend, thanks for coming. - Stupid ceiling. Thank you. What's that he's drinking, do you suppose? I don't know, but I don't think it's pumpkin juice. After due consideration... ...the Ministry has concluded that, for their own safety... ...no student under the age of 17... ...shall be allowed to put forth their name for the Triwizard Tournament. - This decision is final. - That's rubbish! That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing! - Silence! - They're not too happy about that, then. The Goblet of Fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves to the tournament... ...need only write their name upon a piece of parchment... ...and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly. If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, the Triwizard Tournament has begun. Alastor Moody. Ex-Auror... ...Ministry malcontent... ...and your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. I am here because Dumbledore asked me. End of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the Dark Arts... ...I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many Unforgivable Curses there are? - Three, sir. - And they are so named? Because they are unforgivable. The use of any one of them will... Will earn you a one-way ticket to Azkaban, correct. The Ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against! You need to be prepared. You need to find another place to put your chewing gum... ...besides the underside of your desk, Mr. Finnigan! No way. The old codger can see out the back of his head. And hear across classrooms! So which curse shall we see first? - Weasley! - Yes? Stand. Give us a curse. Well, my dad did tell me about one. The Imperius Curse. Oh, yeah, your father would know all about that. Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why. Hello. Lovely little beauty. <i>Engorgio.</i> <i>Imperio!</i> Don't worry. It's completely harmless. If she bites... ...she's lethal. What are you laughing at? Get off! Talented, isn't she? What should I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself? Scores of witches and wizards have claimed... ...that they only did You-Know-Who's bidding... ...under the influence of the Imperius Curse. But here's the rub: How do we sort out the liars? Another, another. Up, up. Come on. Longbottom, is it? Up. Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology. There's the... The Cruciatus Curse. Correct, correct. Come, come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse. <i>Crucio!</i> Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him? Stop it! Perhaps you could give us the last Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger. No? <i>Avada Kedavra!</i> The Killing Curse. Only one person is known to have survived it... ...and he's sitting in this room. Brilliant, isn't he? Completely demented, of course, and terrifying to be in the same room with... ...but he's really been there, you know? He's looked evil in the eye. There's a reason those curses are unforgivable. To perform them in a classroom... I mean, did you see Neville's face? Neville? Son? You all right? Come on. We'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something. We're gonna be late! Come on, Cedric. Put it in! Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it? Three years from now, when we're old enough to be chosen. Yeah, rather you than me. Yes! Thank you, thank you. - Well, lads, we've done it. - Cooked it up just this morning. It's not going to work. - Oh, yeah? - And why is that, Granger? You see this? This is an Age Line. Dumbledore drew it himself. So? So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled... ...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted as an Aging Potion. - But that's why it's so brilliant. - Because it's so pathetically dimwitted. - Ready, Fred? - Ready, George. - Bottoms up. - Bottoms up. - Yes! - Yes! Yeah! Yes! Ready? - Yes! - Yes! - You said! - You said! - Oh, right, you want a piece of me?! - I'll tear your ears off! - Now you're making me laugh. - Take this! Come on! <i>Fight! Fight! Fight!</i> We're ""old school,"" right? Yeah, but you look older! Sit down. Please. Now the moment you've all been waiting for: The champion selection. The Durmstrang champion is Viktor Krum. The champion for Beauxbatons... ...is Fleur Delacour. The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory! Excellent! We now have our three champions. But in the end, only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions... ...this vessel of victory... ...the Triwizard Cup! Harry Potter. Harry Potter? No. No. Harry Potter! Go on, Harry. Harry, for goodness sake. He's a cheat! He's not even 17 yet! - It's wrong, I tell you! - You French tart. - Everything is a conspiracy theory! - Quiet! I can't think! - Everything is a conspiracy theory! - I protest. - Harry. - I protest! Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire? - No, sir. - Did you ask one of the older students... ...to do it for you? - No, sir. - You're absolutely sure? - Yes. Yes, sir. - But of course he is lying. - The hell he is! The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object. Only an exceptionally powerful Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year. You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye. It was once my job to think as dark wizards do, Karkaroff... ...perhaps you remember. - This doesn't help, Alastor. Leave this to you, Barty. The rules are absolute. The Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr. Potter has no choice. He is, as of tonight... ...a Triwizard champion. This can't go on, Albus. First the Dark Mark. Now this? What do you suggest, Minerva? Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete. You heard Barty. The rules are clear. Well, the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accommodate the Ministry? Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence. However, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events... ...perhaps we should, for the time being... ...let them unfold. What...? Do nothing? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat. I agree. With Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you? - I can do that. - Don't let him know, though. He must be anxious enough as it is... ...knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are. How did you do it? Never mind. Doesn't matter. Might've let your best friend know, though. - Let you know what? - You know bloody well what. I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron. Okay? - You're being stupid. - Yeah, that's me. Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's stupid friend. I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory. I just wanna be... Look, I don't know what happened tonight... ...and I don't know why. It just did. Okay? Piss off. What a charismatic quartet. Hello. I'm Rita Skeeter. <i>I write for the Daily Prophet.</i> But of course you know that, don't you? It's you we don't know. You're the juicy news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? What mysteries do the muscles mask? Does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick? ""Me, Myself and l"" want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So who's feeling up to sharing? Shall we start with the youngest? Lovely. This is cozy. It's a broom cupboard. You should feel right at home, then. Don't mind if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you? No. So tell me, Harry. Here you sit, a mere boy of 12... I'm 14. Sorry. - About to compete against three students... ...not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself... ...but who have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt... ...in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned? I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. Just ignore the quill. Then, of course, you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you? - Fourteen. - Your story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past... ...that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament? No, I didn't enter. Of course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel, Harry. Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive... ...how do you think they'd feel? Proud? Or concerned... ...that your attitude shows, at best, a pathological need for attention... ...at worst, a psychotic death wish? Hey, my eyes aren't ""glistening with the ghosts of my past."" <i>Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.</i> <i>Since the World Cup, the Ministry's been intercepting more and more owls...</i> <i>... and she's too easily recognized.</i> <i>We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.</i> <i>Meet me in the Gryffindor common room, 1:00 this Saturday night.</i> <i>And make sure you're alone.</i> <i>Sirius.</i> <i>P. S:</i> <i>The bird bites.</i> Sirius? <i>Harry Potter, age 12...</i> <i>... suspect entrant in the Triwizard Tournament.</i> <i>His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his past...</i> <i>... and choking back tears...</i> Sirius. How...? I don't have much time, so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the Goblet of Fire? No! I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort. But who was the third man in the room? - I don't know. - You didn't hear a name? No. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important. And what was that? He wanted... ...me. I don't know why. But he was gonna use this man to get to me. But, I mean, it was only a dream, right? Yes. It's just a dream. Look, Harry. The Death Eaters at the World Cup, your name rising from that goblet... ...these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe anymore. What are you saying? I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff? He was a Death Eater. And no one, no one stops being a Death Eater. Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone. Sent his own son to Azkaban. You think one of them put my name in the goblet? I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet... ...but whoever did is no friend to you. People die in this tournament. - I'm not ready for this, Sirius. - You don't have a choice. - Someone's coming. - Keep your friends close, Harry. - Who were you talking to? - What? - Who says I was talking to anyone? - I heard voices. Maybe you're imagining things. Wouldn't be the first time. You're probably just practicing for your next interview, I expect. Amazing. - Amazing! - Neville. You're doing it again. Right, sorry. <i>""Magical Water Plants of the Highland Lochs""?</i> Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea. It's already been through enough people. Why don't you just go and talk to him yourself? Ron, this is your problem, not mine. What do you want me to say again? Go. Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him... ...that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid's looking for you. Is that right? Well, you... What? - Are you sure you won't do this? - Do it. Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me to say it again. Hagrid's looking for you. - Well, you can tell Ronald... - I'm not an owl! Did you bring your father's cloak, like I asked you? Yeah, I brought the cloak. Hagrid, where are we going? You'll see soon enough. Now pay attention, this is important. What's with the flower? Hagrid, have you combed your hair? As a matter of fact, I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again. Hagrid? The cloak! Put the cloak on! <i>- Bonsoir, Olympe. - Oh, Hagrid.</i> I thought perhaps you weren't coming. I thought perhaps... ...you had forgotten me. Couldn't forget you, Olympe. What is it you wanted to show me? When we spoke earlier, you sounded so... ...exhilarated. You'll be glad you came. Trust me. Can we get closer? Dragons? That's the first task? - You're joking. - Come on, Harry. These are seriously misunderstood creatures. Oh, crikey! Although, I have to admit... ...that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him, you know. - Ron was here? - Oh, sure. His brother Charlie helped to bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that? No, he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing. - You cheat, Potter. - You stink, Potter. - Good luck, Potter. - Potter stinks! - Cedric rules. - Thanks. Like the badge? Excuse me. Harry. Hey! Read the badge, Potter! Can I have a word? - All right. - You stink, Potter! - Potter, you stink! - Harry Potter smells! Dragons. That's the first task. - They've got one for each of us. - Come on, Ced! Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...? - Yes. - Come on, Ced, leave him. - Right. - He's not worth it. - Read the badges, Potter! - Hey, listen. About the badges. - I've asked them not to wear them, but... - Don't worry about it. It's not like I try to blow things up, exactly. It just happens a fair bit. You have to admit, though, fire's pretty fascinating. You're a right foul git, you know that? - You think so? - I know so. Anything else? - Yeah. Stay away from me. - Fine. - There's Potter. Cheat. - Why so tense, Potter? My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're gonna last 10 minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five. I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy. He's vile and cruel. And you're just pathetic. - Pathetic? - Oh, no, you don't, sonny! I'll teach you to curse someone when their back is turned! You stinking, cowardly, scummy... - Professor Moody! ...back-shooting... - What are you doing? - Teaching. - Is that a...? Is that a student? - Technically, it's a ferret. Stand still! Stand still! - My father will hear about this! - Is that a threat? - Professor Moody! - Is that a threat? Professor! I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair! - Alastor! Alastor. - It doesn't end here! We never use transfiguration as a punishment! Surely Dumbledore told you that. - He might've mentioned it. - Well, you will do well to remember it. Away! You. Come with me. That's a Foe-Glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes, they're standing right behind me. Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in there. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... ...what are you going to do about your dragon? Well, you know, I just thought I'd... Sit. Listen to me, Potter. Your pal Diggory? By your age, he could turn a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour? She's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust... ...but Karkaroff's is not. They'll have a strategy. And you can bet that it will play to Krum's strengths. Come on, Potter. What are your strengths? I don't know. Well, I can fly. I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I... - Better than fair, the way I heard it. - But I'm not allowed a broom. You're allowed a wand. Bets! Place your bets! Bets taken! Bets taken here! Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter in today's bloodbath? Smart money's on Krum to survive! Any bets? Yes, sir? Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go. Thank you very much. <i>Your attention, please.</i> <i>This is a great day for all of us.</i> <i>Each of the three tasks involves very considerable danger.</i> <i>Please keep your seats at all times.</i> <i>This will minimize any risks you may be exposed to.</i> - Harry? Is that you? - Yeah. <i>I'm sure we all wish our champions...</i> <i>- How are you feeling? Okay? - ... the greatest of luck.</i> The key is to concentrate. After that, you just have to... Battle a dragon. Young love. How... ...stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today... ...you two may even make the front page. You have no business here. This tent is for champions... ...and friends. No matter. We've got what we wanted. Good day, champions. Gather round, please. Now, you've waited, you've wondered, and at last the moment has arrived. A moment only four of you can fully appreciate. What are you doing here, Miss Granger? Sorry, I'll just go. Barty, the bag. Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum. And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here. That's right. Now... ...Miss Delacour, if you will. The Welsh Green. Mr. Krum. The Chinese Fireball. The Swedish Short-Snout. - Which leaves... - The Horntail. - What's that, boy? - Nothing. The Hungarian Horntail. These represent four very real dragons... ...each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple: Collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue... ...without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions? Very well. Good luck, champions. Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon, you may... <i>Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!</i> <i>Three of our champions have now faced their dragons...</i> <i>... and so each one of them will proceed to the next task.</i> <i>And now our fourth and final contestant.</i> <i>Harry! Harry! Harry!</i> Your wand, Harry! Your wand! <i>Accio Firebolt!</i> - Yeah! - Yes! Oh, my God. - Yeah! - Yeah! Well done, dragon! Yes! Yes! - Yes, Harry! - Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg. - Or an arm. - Pack it in altogether? - Never! - Never! Shush! Go on, Harry. What's the clue? - Who wants me to open it? - Yes! - Do you want me to open it? - Yes! What the bloody hell was that? All right, everyone! Go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosy sods listening in. I reckon you have to be barking mad to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire. Caught on, have you? Took you long enough. I wasn't the only one who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back. Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better. - Least I warned you about the dragons. - Hagrid warned me about the dragons. No, no, no, I did. No, don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you... ...that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought we'd be all right, you know... ...after you'd figured that out. Who...? Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental. Yeah. Isn't it? I suppose I was a bit distraught. Boys. - Hi, Harry. - Hi, Harry. Cho, Harry's looking at you. Shush. Look at this! I can't believe it! She's done it again. ""Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl... ...seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey, sources report... ...is none other than the Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow."" Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley. Thank you, Nigel. Not now, Nigel. Later. Go on. I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh, look, Mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress. Well, it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet? Nose down, Harry. - Ginny, these must be for you. - I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly. What are you on about? They're not for Ginny. They're for you. - Dress robes. - Dress robes? For what? The Yule Ball... ...has been a tradition of the Triwizard Tournament... ...since its inception. On Christmas Eve night, we and our guests... ...gather in the Great Hall... ...for a night of well-mannered frivolity. As representatives of the host school... ...I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward. And I mean this literally, because... ...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost... ...a dance. Silence! The house of Godric Gryffindor has commanded the respect... ...of the wizard world for nearly 10 centuries. I will not have you, in the course of a single evening, besmirching that name... ...by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons. Try saying that five times fast, huh? Now, to dance... ...is to let the body breathe. Inside every girl, a secret swan slumbers... ...Ionging to burst forth and take flight. Something's about to burst out of Eloise Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan. Inside every boy, a lordly lion prepared to prance. - Mr. Weasley. - Yes? Will you join me, please? Now, place your right hand on my waist. - Where? - My waist. And extend your arm. Mr. Filch, if you please. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Never gonna let him forget this, are you? - Never. - Never. Everybody come together. Boys, on your feet! Why do they have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one on their own to ask them? Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons. If you can't get a date, who can? I think I'd take the dragon right now. I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well. She left when I was about 3. No, not the maternal sort, her. Broke me dad's heart, though. He was a tiny little fella, my dad. I could pick him up at the age of 6 with one hand and put him up on the dresser. He laughed so hard at that. Very funny. And then he died just when I started school, so... So I sort of had to make me own way, as it were. But enough of me. What about you? This is mad. At this rate, we'll be the only ones in our year without dates. Well, us and Neville. Yeah, but, then again, he can take himself. It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone. Now I'm really depressed. ""Get a move on or all the good ones will have gone."" Who you going with, then? <i>- Oi, Angelina? - What?</i> Do you wanna go to the ball with me? To the ball? Yeah, all right. Oi, Hermione. You're a girl. Very well spotted. Come with one of us? Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl, it's just sad. I won't be going alone, because, believe it or not, someone's asked me! And I said yes! Bloody hell. She's lying, right? If you say so. Look, we've just gotta grit our teeth and do it. Tonight, when we get back to the common room... ...we'll both have partners. Agreed? Agreed. - Cho! - Harry! Watch yourself on the stairs. It's a bit icy at the top. Okay, thanks. Cho? Yes? Well, I just wondered if you... I wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me. Sorry, I didn't catch that. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me. Harry... ...I'm sorry, but someone's already asked me. And... Well, I've said I'll go with him. Okay. Yeah. Great. Fine. No problem. Okay. Good. Harry? I really am... ...sorry. It's all right, Ron. It's okay, Ron. It's all right. It doesn't matter. What happened to you? He just asked Fleur Delacour out. - What? - What did she say? No, of course. - She said yes? - Don't be silly. There she was, walking by. You know how I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it. It just sort of slipped out. Actually, he sort of screamed at her. It was a bit frightening. - And what did you do then? - What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this, Harry. I don't know what got into me. - Hi, Harry. - Hi, Harry. I always liked looking at them from behind. She's never gonna forgive me, ever. Hey! Bloody hell. Bloody hell. Bloody... Oh, bloody... What are those? What are those? - My dress robes. - Well, they're all right! No lace. No dodgy little collar. Well, I expect yours are more traditional. Traditional?! They're ancient! I look like my Great Aunt Tessie! I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie. Murder me, Harry. Leave it alone! Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room, crying her eyes out. - Who? - Hermione, of course. Come on, Harry, why do you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with? Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did. Nobody asked her. Would've taken her myself if she wasn't so bloody proud. - Hello, boys. - Hello, boys. Don't you look... ...dashing. There you are, Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready? - Ready, professor? - To dance. It's traditional that the three champions... Well, in this case, four. - Are the first to dance. - Surely I told you that. - No. Well, now you know. As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed into the Great Hall with Miss Patil. - Oh, there you are. - Come on, then. Come along this way. Oh, come on. - Hi. - Now, I need you all to line up... ...in the procession, please. Oh, you are very late. This way. This way. Come along. She looks beautiful! Yeah, she does. Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum? No. Absolutely not. Hi! Harry, take my waist. - What? - Now! Are you ready? <i>Move your body like a hairy troll</i> <i>Learning to rock and roll</i> <i>Spin around like a crazy elf</i> <i>Dancing by himself</i> <i>Boogie down like a unicorn</i> <i>No stopping till the break of dawn</i> <i>Put your hands up in the air</i> <i>Like an ogre who just don 't care</i> <i>Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</i> Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he? I don't think it was the books that had him going to the library. May I have your arm? Arm. Leg. I'm yours. Hot, isn't it? Viktor's gone to go and get drinks. Would you care to join us? No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor. What's got your wand in a knot? He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternizing with the enemy. The enemy? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament... ...is international magical cooperation... ...to make friends. I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind. Are you going to ask me to dance or not? No. - He's using you. - How dare you?! - Besides, I can take care of myself. - I doubt it. He's way too old. - What?! What? That's what you think? - Yeah, that's what I think. You know the solution then, don't you? - Go on. - Next time there's a ball... ...pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does! And not as a last resort. Well, that's... I mean, that's just completely off the point. Harry. Where have you been? Never mind! Off to bed, both of you. - They get scary when they get older. - Ron, you spoiled everything! What's this about? <i>No, don 't let</i> <i>This magic die</i> <i>The answer's there</i> Let me see it again. Yes, the time is close now. <i>Harry, at last!</i> Step aside, Wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting. You all right, Harry? I just got in. Me. Harry, you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. - The task is two days from now. - Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out. Wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the tournament. Actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly loquacious. Mostly, he watches me study. It's a bit annoying, actually. You are trying to figure this egg out, aren't you? What's that supposed to mean? It just means these tasks are designed to test you... ...in the most brutal way. They're almost cruel. And... ...I'm scared for you. You got by the dragons mostly on nerve. I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time. Hey, Potter! - Potter! - Cedric. How...? How are you? Spectacular. I realize I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons. Forget it. I'm sure you would've done the same for me. Exactly. You know the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor? It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg... ...and mull things over in the hot water. I must be out of my mind. I'm definitely out of my mind. I'd try putting it in the water if I were you. Myrtle! Hello, Harry. Long time no see. I was circling a blocked drain the other day... ...and could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion. Not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry? Polyjuice Potion? Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say, ""Try putting it in the water""? That's what he did. The other boy... ...the handsome one... ...Cedric. Well, go on. Open it. <i>Come seek us Where our voices sound</i> <i>We cannot sing Above the ground</i> <i>An hour long you'll have to look</i> <i>To recover what we took</i> Myrtle... ...there aren't merpeople in the Black Lake, are there? Very good. It took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone. Harry, tell me again. ""Come seek us where our voices sound."" The Black Lake, that's obvious. ""An hour long you'll have to look."" Again, obvious. Though, admittedly, potentially problematic. ""Potentially problematic""? When's the last time you held your breath underwater for an hour, Hermione? Look, Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out. Hate to break up the skull session. Professor McGonagall wants you in her office. Not you, Potter, just Weasley and Granger. But, sir, the second task is only hours away, and... Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now... ...and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom! Why don't you help Potter put his books back. You know, if you're interested in plants... <i>...you'd be better off with Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.</i> Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal who's growing gravity-resistant trees? Neville, no offense, but I really don't care... ...about plants. Now, if there's... ...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour... ...then great. But otherwise... I don't know about a turnip. But you could always use gillyweed. - Any bets? Any bets? - Come on, place your bets! Step up, mates! Don't be shy. - Three lads. - One lady. - Four go down. - But do four come up? Don't be so mean. - Any bets? - Fleur's 10-1. - You're sure about this, Neville? - Absolutely. - For an hour? - Most likely. Most likely? Well, there is some debate among herbologists... ...as to the effects of fresh water versus salt water... You're telling me this now? You must be joking! I just wanted to help. Well, that makes you a right sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway? - You seem a little tense, Harry. - Do I? <i>Welcome to the second task.</i> <i>Last night, something was stolen from each of our champions.</i> <i>A treasure of sorts.</i> <i>These four treasures, one for each champion...</i> <i>... now lie on the bottom of the Black Lake.</i> <i>In order to win...</i> <i>... each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface.</i> <i>- Simple enough, except for this: - Put that in your mouth.</i> <i>They will have but one hour to do so, and one hour only.</i> <i>After that, they'll be on their own. No magic will save them.</i> <i>You may begin at the sound of the cannon.</i> - What's the matter with him? - I don't know, I can't see him. Oh, my God. I've killed Harry Potter. Yeah! What? <i>The Beauxbatons champion, Miss Delacour...</i> <i>... has unfortunately been forced to retire...</i> <i>... so she will take no further part in this task.</i> But she's my friend too! Only one! Let's get down below. <i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i> Yes! <i>Ascendio!</i> Harry! He's all right. He's all right. Barty! - Go get him another towel. - I want all the judges over here now! You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister. Thank you. And you! You helped. Well, yeah, a bit. - Harry! - Hermione! Are you all right? You must be freezing. Personally, I think you behaved admirably. I finished last, Hermione. Next to last. Fleur never got past the Grindylows. Krum! Krum! Krum! - Come on! Come on! - Attention! Attention! The winner is Mr. Diggory... ...who showed innate command of the Bubble-Head Charm. However, seeing as Mr. Potter would have finished first... ...had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr. Weasley... ...but the others as well, we've agreed to award him... ...second place... - Second place! - Well done! ...for outstanding moral fiber! Yes! - Right on. - All that moral fiber, eh? - It's great. - Moral fiber? Blimey. Even when you go wrong, it turns out right. - Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber. - Congratulations, Potter. - A fine achievement. - Thank you. Well done, boy. - See you at Hagrid's, Harry. - I'm sorry we haven't spoken. After all, your story is one I've heard so many times. Quite remarkable, really. Tragic, of course... ...to lose one's family. Never whole again, are we? Still, life goes on... ...and here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud of you today, Potter. Bartemius! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the Ministry's summer internships, are we? The last boy who went into the Department of Mysteries never came out! And they say I'm mad. Now, I remember... I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on. Suppose you remind me of meself a little. - And here we all are, four years later. - We're still a bunch of misfits. Well, maybe, but we've all got each other. And Harry, of course. Soon to be the youngest Triwizard champion there's ever been! Hooray! <i>Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</i> <i>Teach us something, please</i> Mr. Crouch? A man has died here, Fudge. And he won't be the last. You must take action. I will not. In times like these, the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore! Then for once show them some! The Triwizard Tournament will not be canceled. I will not be seen as a coward! A true leader does what is right, no matter what others think. - What did you say to me? - Excuse me, gentlemen. It may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private. Oh, Harry! Harry, how good to see you again. I can come back later, professor. Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. There you are. Your hat. Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in a little Licorice Snap in my absence. But I have to warn you, they're a wee bit sharp. Professor? - Professor. - Yeah. Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request... ...to present evidence to this council. Should your testimony prove consequential... ...council may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time, you remain in the eyes of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater. Do you accept these terms? - I do, sir. - And what do you wish to present? I have names, sir. There was Rosier, Evan Rosier. - Rosier is dead. - He took a piece of me with him... ...though, didn't he? - I didn't know. - Lf that is all the witness has to offer... - No, no, no. There was Rookwood! He was a spy. Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries? Yeah, the same. He passed information to You-Know-Who from inside the Ministry itself. Very well. Council will deliberate. In the meantime, you will return to Azkaban. No! Wait, please! Please, I have more! What about Snape? Severus Snape? As the council is aware, I've given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall... ...turned spy for us at great personal risk. - It's a lie! - Today he's no more a Death Eater than I. - Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord! Silence! Unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence... ...this session is now concluded. Oh, no, no, no. I've heard about one more. - What's that? - The name. - Yes? - I know for a fact... ...this person took part in the capture... ...and, by means of the Cruciatus Curse... ...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife! The name. Give me the wretched name! Barty Crouch... ...Junior. Hold him down! Get your filthy hands off me, you pathetic little men! Hello, Father. You are no son of mine. Curiosity is not a sin, Harry. But you should exercise caution. It's a Pensieve. Very useful if, like me, you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see once more things I've already seen. You see, Harry, I have searched and searched for something... ...some small detail... ...something I might have overlooked... ...something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer, it slips away. It's maddening. Sir? Mr. Crouch's son. What exactly happened to him? He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice. The evidence was overwhelming. - Why do you ask? - It's just that I... I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. <i>In the dream, I was in a house.</i> <i>And Voldemort was there, only he wasn 't quite human.</i> <i>And Wormtail was there too. And Mr. Crouch 's son.</i> <i>- Have there been others like this dream? - Yes.</i> Always the same one. Sir, these dreams... ...what I see, you don't think it's actually happening, do you? I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams, Harry. I think it's best if you simply... ...cast them away. It's a sign, Severus. You know what it means as well as I. Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the Black Lake was inspiring. Gillyweed, am I correct? Yes, sir. Ingenious. A rather rare herb, gillyweed. Not something found in your everyday garden. Nor is this. Know what it is? Bubble juice, sir? Veritaserum. Three drops of this and You-Know-Who himself would spill his darkest secrets. The use of it on a student is, regrettably, forbidden. However... ...should you ever steal from my personal stores again... ...my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice. - I haven't stolen anything. - Don't lie to me. Gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin, lacewing flies? You and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me... ...I'm going to find out why! - Yeah! - Yeah! <i>Sonorus!</i> Earlier today, Professor Moody placed the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now, as Mr. Diggory... ...and Mr. Potter... ...are tied for first position... ...they will be the first to enter the maze, followed by Mr. Krum... ...and Miss Delacour. - Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum! The first person to touch the cup will be the winner! I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter. Should, at any point, a contestant wish to withdraw from the task... ...he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants! Gather around. Quickly! In the maze, you'll find no dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead, you'll face something even more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh, find the cup if you can. But be very wary, you could just lose yourselves along the way. Champions, prepare yourselves! Good luck. - My boy. - See you later, Dad. On the count of three. One... Fleur? Fleur. <i>Periculum!</i> Get down! Get down! <i>Expelliarmus!</i> No, don't! Stop! He's bewitched, Cedric! - Get off me! - He's bewitched! Yes. Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry! <i>Reducto!</i> - Thanks. - No problem. You know, for a moment there, I thought you were gonna let it get me. For a moment, so did I. Some game, huh? Some game. Go! Go on, take it. You saved me, take it! - Together. One, two... - Two... ...three! ...three! - You okay? - Yeah. You? Where are we? I've been here before. It's a Portkey. - Harry, the cup is a Portkey. - I've been here before, in a dream. Cedric! We have to get back to the cup. Now! What are you talking about? - Harry! What is it? - Get back to the cup! - Who are you? What do you want? - Kill the spare. <i>- Avada Kedavra! - No! Cedric!</i> Do it! Now! Bone of the father... ...unwillingly given. Flesh of the servant... ...willingly sacrificed. And blood of the enemy... ...forcibly taken. The Dark Lord shall rise... ...again. My wand, Wormtail. Hold out your arm. Master. Thank you, master. The other arm, Wormtail. Welcome, my friends. Thirteen years it's been, and yet... ...here you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself... ...disappointed. Not one of you tried to find me. Crabbe! Macnair! Goyle! Not even you... ...Lucius. My Lord, had I detected any sign, a whisper of your whereabouts... There were signs, my slippery friend. And more than whispers. I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence... ...that is my true mask. I returned. Out of fear, not loyalty. Still, you have proved yourself useful these past few months, Wormtail. Thank you, master. Thank you. - Such a handsome boy. - Don't touch him! Harry. I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. Yeah. I'd introduce you... ...but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend, Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night 13 years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? Yes, shall I? It was love. You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son... ...she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch him. It was old magic. Something I should have foreseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed. I can touch you... ...now. Yeah. Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry? Pick up your wand, Potter. I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up! You've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes? First, we bow to each other. Come on, now, Harry. The niceties must be observed. Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he? I said, bow. - That's better. And now... - No. <i>Crucio!</i> <i>Crucio!</i> Attaboy, Harry. Your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy Muggle mother. <i>Expelliar...</i> I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter. I'm going to destroy you. After tonight, no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight, if they speak of you... ...they'll speak only of how you... ...begged for death. And I, being a merciful Lord... ...obliged. Get up! Don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter! I want you to look at me when I kill you! I want to see the light leave your eyes! Have it your way. <i>- Expelliarmus! - Avada Kedavra!</i> Do nothing! He's mine to finish! He's mine! Harry, when the connection is broken, you must get to the Portkey. We can linger for a moment to give you some time... ...but only a moment. Do you understand? Harry, take my body back, will you? Take my body back to my father. Let go. Sweetheart, you're ready. Let go! Let go! <i>Accio!</i> No! He did it! Harry! Harry! No! No! No, don't! For God's sake, Dumbledore, what's happened? He's back. He's back. Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there. It's all right, Harry. It's all right. He's home. You both are. Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved, Dumbledore. There are too many people. Let me through. Let me through! Let me through! That's my son! That's my boy! It's my boy! - Come on. Get up. Easy, easy! - No. This is not where you want to be right now. Come on. No! It's all right, I got you. I got you. Come on. Easy, now. No! No! Are you all right, Potter? Does it hurt? That? Not so much now. Perhaps I'd better take a look at it. The cup was a Portkey. Someone had bewitched it. What was it like? - What was he like? - Who? The Dark Lord. What was it like to stand in his presence? I don't know. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams... ...into one of my nightmares. Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others? I... I don't think I said anything about a graveyard, professor. ""Marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't they?"" Did you think that miserable oaf would've led you into the woods... ...if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater... ...if I hadn't told him first myself? Did you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder... ...could've provided you with gillyweed if I hadn't given him the book... ...that led him straight to it? It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire. - You bewitched Krum, but you... - ""But... But..."" You won because I made it so, Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the Dark Lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns... ...that I have once and for all... ...silenced the great Harry Potter. <i>Expelliarmus!</i> Severus. That's it, take it. - Do you know who I am? - Albus Dumbledore. - Are you Alastor Moody? Are you? - No. Is he in this room? Is he in this room? Harry, away from there! - You all right, Alastor? - I'm sorry, Albus. That's Moody. But then who's...? Polyjuice Potion. Now we know who's been stealing from your stores, Severus. We'll get you up in a minute. Harry! Barty Crouch Junior. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. Your arm, Harry. You know what this means, don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned. I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it. Send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner. - I'll be welcomed back like a hero. - Perhaps. Personally, I've never had much time for heroes. Today, we acknowledge... ...a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was, as you all know... ...exceptionally hard-working... ...infinitely fair-minded... ...and, most importantly... ...a fierce, fierce friend. Now, I think, therefore, you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see... ...Cedric Diggory was murdered... ...by Lord Voldemort! The Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so, I think, would be an insult to his memory. Now, the pain... ...we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me... ...and reminds us... ...that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues... ...our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events... ...the bonds of friendship we've made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that, and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain. You remember that... ...and we'll celebrate a boy who was... ...kind and honest... ...and brave and true, right to the very end. I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year. By accident, of course. I put you in terrible danger this year, Harry. I'm sorry. Professor... ...when I was in the graveyard, there was a moment... ...when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected. <i>Priori Incantatem.</i> You saw your parents that night, didn't you? They reappeared. No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. I trust you know that. Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy. But remember this: You have friends here. You're not alone. Hermione. This is for you. Write to me. Promise. Bye. <i>Au revoir, Ron.</i> Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts? - No. - No. No, I didn't think so. Oh, well. What's life without a few dragons? Everything's going to change now, isn't it? Yes. Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you. I won't. You know I won't. - Harry will, won't you? - Yeah. Every week.",0.8267197906970978,0.9331337809562683,0.6269191801548004,0.5989968925714493,0.3061773031949997,0.4291031211614609
5 Harry,"I don't know about you, it's just too hot today, isn't it? And it's going to get even worse. Temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius... ...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100. So, please, remember to cover up and stay cool... ...with the hottest hits on your FM dial. Come on, guys, time to go home. Come on, love, off you get. - Do we have to? - Yes, we do. I'll make you your favorite dinner to compensate. He squealed like a pig, didn't he? Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D. Did you see his face? Hey, Big D. Beat up another 10-year-old? - This one deserved it. - Yeah. - Five against one, very brave. - Well, you're one to talk. Moaning in your sleep every night? At least I'm not afraid of my pillow. ""Don't kill Cedric."" Who's Cedric, your boyfriend? - Shut up. - ""He's going to kill me, Mum."" Where is your mum? Where is your mum, Potter? She dead? Is she dead? Is she a dead Pott...? - Dudley. - Dudley, let's go. - What's going on? - What are you doing? - I'm not doing anything. - We're getting out of here, Dudley. Come on, Dudley, hurry up. Dudley, run. Expecto Patronum. Mrs. Figg. Don't put away your wand, Harry. They might come back. Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next? - Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. - I don't understand. How do you know...? Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you. Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore? After You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year... ...did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own? Good Lord, boy. They told me you were intelligent. Now, get inside and stay there. Expect someone will be in touch soon. Whatever happens, don't leave the house. It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere. There's sweat. There's stifling. Diddykins? Is that you? Duddy. Vernon, come quick. We're going to have to take him to a hospital. Who did this to you, boy? Happy, are we, now? You've finally done it. You've finally driven him loopy. Vernon, don't say that. Well, just look at him, Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy. I've reached my limit, do you hear? This is the last I'm gonna take of you and your nonsense. - Dear Mr. Potter. - What? The Ministry has received intelligence that at 6:23 this evening... ...you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle. As a clear violation... ...of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery... ...you are hereby expelled... ...from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk. Justice. He's not very well. Sorry, Hedwig. Very clean, these Muggles. - Tonks, for God's sake. - Unnatural. Professor Moody. - What are you doing here? - Rescuing you, of course. But where are we going? The letter said I've been expelled. You haven't been. Not yet. Kingsley, you take point. But the letter said... Dumbledore persuaded the minister to suspend your expulsion... ...pending a formal hearing. - A hearing? Don't worry. We'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters. Not here, Nymphadora. Don't call me Nymphadora. Stay in formation, everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed. Come on, you, around the corner. Come on. In you go, son. There've been no sightings. No deaths. No proof. He almost killed Harry. If that isn't proof enough... Yes, but guarding you-know-what is the most important... We must trust Dumbledore on this. Was he able to protect Harry last year? Tonight I say it's time to take action. Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second. - His instinct would be to ignore it... - Keep your voices down. He's getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now. - Harry. - Mrs. Weasley. Heavens, you're all right. Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting's finished. Nope. No time to explain. Straight upstairs, first door on the left. Yeah. Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves. If my poor mistress knew the scum they let into her house... ...what would she say to old Kreacher? Oh, the shame. - Freaks. - There, there, mistress. Scum of the earth. Not like it was in the days of my fathers. Kreacher is here. Oh, Harry. Are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack. - You must tell us everything. - Let the man breathe, Hermione. And this hearing at the Ministry. It's just outrageous. I've looked it up. They simply can't expel you. - It's completely unfair. - Yeah. There's a lot of that going round at the moment. So, what is this place? - It's headquarters. - Of the Order of the Phoenix. It's a secret society. Dumbledore formed it back when they fought You-Know-Who. Couldn't have put any of this in a letter, I suppose? I've gone all summer without a scrap of news. We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did. - Only... - Only what? Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything. Dumbledore said that? But why would he keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help. I'm the one who saw Voldemort return... ...the one who fought him, who saw Cedric Diggory get killed. - Harry. - Thought we heard your dulcet tones. - Don't bottle it up, though. Let it out. - If you're all done shouting... Do you wanna hear something a little more interesting? If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for Harry... ...we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back. He's not a child, Molly. But he's not an adult either. - He's not James, Sirius. - Well, he's not your son. He's as good as. - Who else has he got? - Hey, Ginny. - He's got me. - How touchingly paternal, Black. Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather. Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus. - Snape's part of the Order? - Git. About your supposed reformation. - I know better. - So why don't you tell him? - Get off it. - Quick. - Get it up. - Crookshanks. - Stop it. - Get off, you bloody cat. - Crookshanks. Leave it alone. - Get it up. - Hermione, I hate your cat. - Bad Crookshanks. Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen. Just because you're allowed to use magic now... ...does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything. Hi, Mum. You hungry, Harry? You sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn. Harry Potter. Sirius. This is very, very peculiar. It seems your hearing in the Ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot. I don't understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me? Show him. He'll find out soon enough. He's been attacking Dumbledore as well. Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet... ...to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned. Why? He thinks Dumbledore's after his job. No one in their right mind could believe that... Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind. It's been twisted and warped by fear. Now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry. The last time Voldemort gained power... ...he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the minister will do almost anything... ...to avoid facing that terrifying truth. We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again. Fourteen years ago, he had huge numbers at his command. And not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures. He's been recruiting heavily, and we've been attempting to do the same. But gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in. We believe... ...Voldemort may be after something. Sirius. Something he didn't have last time. You mean like a weapon? No. That's enough. He's just a boy. You say more and you might as well induct him into the Order. Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight. Harry. You are hereby expelled. Before the entire Wizengamot. Trains. Underground. Ingenious, these Muggles. Here we are. I've never used the visitors' entrance before. Should be fun. Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money. Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market. Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet? Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous? - Morning, Arthur. - Morning, Bob. Interdepartmental memos. We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable. Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley. They've changed the time of your hearing. When is it? In five minutes. Department of Mysteries. And I'm confident, minister, that you will do the right thing. Yes, but we must be... Remember, during the hearing, speak only when you're spoken to. Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong. As the Muggles say, truth will out. Yes? I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid. Good luck, Harry. Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August... ...into offenses committed by Harry James Potter... ...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag... Witness for the defense. Albus Percival Wulfric... ...Brian Dumbledore. You got our message that the time and place of the hearing... ...had been changed, did you? - I must have missed it. But by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. The charges? The charges against the accused are as follows: ""That he did knowingly... ...and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions... ...produce a Patronus Charm... ...in the presence of a Muggle."" - Do you deny producing said Patronus? - No, but... And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school... ...while under the age of 17? - Yes, I was, but... Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot... I was only doing it because of the Dementors. Dementors? In Little Whinging? That's quite clever. Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy? - Highly convenient. - I'm not lying. - There were two of them, if I hadn't... - Enough. I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would be a very well-rehearsed story... ...but since you can produce no witnesses of the event... Pardon me, minister, but as it happens, we can. Please describe the attack. What did they look like? Well, one of them was very large and the other rather skinny. Not the boys. The Dementors. Oh, right, right. Well, big. Cloaked. Then everything went cold... ...as though all the happiness had gone from the world. Now, look here. Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb... ...and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical. I don't think anyone would believe... ...the Dementors were there by coincidence, minister. I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, professor. Dementors are, after all, under the control of the Ministry of Magic. And it's so silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though... ...you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy. That would be disturbing indeed, Madam Undersecretary... ...which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry... ...into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban... ...and why they mounted an attack without authorization. Of course, there is someone... ...who might be behind the attack. Cornelius, I implore you to see reason. The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible. He is not back. In the matter of Harry Potter... ...the law clearly states... ...that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations. Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore. Clearly. Has it become practice to hold a full criminal trial... ...to deal with a simple matter of underage magic? Those in favor of conviction? Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges? Cleared of all charges. Professor. Padfoot. Are you barking mad? You'll blow the entire operation. Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you... I had to see you off, didn't I? What's life without a little risk? I don't wanna see you get chucked back in Azkaban. Don't worry about me. Anyway, I wanted you to have this. Original Order of the Phoenix. Marlene McKinnon. She was killed two weeks after this was taken. Voldemort wiped out her entire family. Frank and Alice Longbottom. Neville's parents. They suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me. It's been 14 years. And still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad. Do you really think there's going to be a war, Sirius? It feels like it did before. You keep it. Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now. I'll see you at the train. Bye-bye, darling. I love you. Hold my hand, lovey. There they are. They're in the far carriage. Bye. I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free. Better enjoy it while you can. I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it. - What'd I tell you? Complete nutter. - Just stay away from me! It's only Malfoy. What'd you expect? Hi, guys. - Hey, Neville. - Hey there, Neville. What is it? - What's what? - That. Pulling the carriage. Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself, like always. You're not going mad. I can see them too. You're just as sane as I am. Everyone, this is Loony Love... Luna Lovegood. What an interesting necklace. It's a charm, actually. Keeps away the Nargles. Hungry. I hope there's pudding. - What's a Nargle? - No idea. Good evening, children. Now, we have two changes in staffing this year. We're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank... ...who'll be taking Care of Magical Creatures... ...while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave. We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... ...Professor Dolores Umbridge. And I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the professor good luck. Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you... She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge. Thank you, headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright... ...happy faces smiling up at me. I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends. - That's likely. - That's likely. The Ministry of Magic has always considered... ...the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. Although each headmaster... ...has brought something new to this historic school... ...progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged. Let us preserve what must be preserved... ...perfect what can be perfected... ...and prune practices that ought to be prohibited. Thank you, Professor Umbridge. That really was most illuminating. - Illuminating? What a load of waffle. - What's it mean? Magic is forbidden in the corridors... It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts. Dean, Seamus. - Good holiday? - All right. Better than Seamus', anyway. Me mum didn't want me to come back this year. - Why not? - Let me see. Because of you. The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you and Dumbledore. What, your mum believes them? Nobody was there the night Cedric died. I guess you should read the Prophet, then, like your stupid mother. - Don't talk about my mother. - I'll have a go at anyone calling me a liar. - What's going on? - He's mad, is what's going on. Do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who? Yeah. I do. Has anyone else got a problem with Harry? - You all right? - Fine. Seamus was bang out of order, mate. - But he'll come through, you'll see. - I said, I'm fine, Ron. Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then. Harry. Bring it over here. Over here. Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it. Good morning, children. Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations. O- W-Ls. More commonly known as OWLs. Study hard and you will be rewarded. Fail to do so, and the consequences may be severe. Your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven. But you'll be pleased to know, from now on... ...you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved... ...course of defensive magic. Yes? There's nothing in here about using defensive spells? Using spells? Well, I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom. We're not gonna use magic? You'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way. What use is that? If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free. Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class. It is the view of the Ministry... ...that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient... ...to get you through your examinations... ...which, after all, is what school is all about. And how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there? There is nothing out there, dear. Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself? Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort. Now, let me make this quite plain. You have been told... ...that a certain dark wizard is at large once again. - This is a lie. - It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him. Detention, Mr. Potter. Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord? Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident. It was murder. Voldemort killed him. Enough! Enough. See me later, Mr. Potter. My office. Come in. Good evening, Mr. Potter. Sit. You're going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill. Going to be using a rather special one of mine. Now... ...I want you to write, ""I must not tell lies."" How many times? Well, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in. You haven't given me any ink. Oh, you won't need any ink. Yes? - Nothing. - That's right. Because you know, deep down... ...you deserve to be punished. Don't you, Mr. Potter? Go on. - Skiving Snackboxes. - Sweets that make you ill. Get out of class whenever you like. Obtain hours of pleasure from unprofitable boredom. Care for another? - I'm not asking you to write all of it. - Please. I've been busy studying for these stupid OWL exams. I'll do the introduction. That's all. Hermione, you're honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met. - And if I'm ever rude to you again... - I'll know you've gone back to normal. What's wrong with your hand? Nothing. The other hand. - You've got to tell Dumbledore. - No. Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now. I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction. Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you. - If the parents knew about this... - I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron? Harry, you've got to report this. - It's perfectly simple. You're being... - No, it's not. Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple. You don't understand. Then help us to. Dear Padfoot... ...I hope you're all right. It's starting to get colder here. Winter is definitely on the way. In spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever. I know you, of all people, will understand. Hello, Harry Potter. - Your feet. Aren't they cold? - Bit. Unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared. I suspect Nargles are behind it. - What are they? - They're called Thestrals. They're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're a bit... Different. But why can't the others see them? They can only be seen by people who've seen death. So you've known someone who's died, then? My mum. She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment... ...and one day, one of her spells went badly wrong. - I was 9. - I'm sorry. Yes, it was rather horrible. I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I've got Dad. We both believe you, by the way. That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and you fought him... ...and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you. Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do. I don't think that's true. But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel. What do you mean? Well, if I were You-Know-Who... ...I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else... ...because if it's just you alone... ...you're not as much of a threat. - Do you ever stop eating? - What? I'm hungry. Harry. Can I join you? Pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating? I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students... ...you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices. So silly of me, but it sounds... ...as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom... ...Minerva. Not at all, Dolores, merely your medieval methods. I am sorry, dear. But to question my practices is to question the Ministry... ...and by extension, the minister himself. I am a tolerant woman... ...but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty. Disloyalty. Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. Cornelius will want to take immediate action. What's happened to Dumbledore? Having already revolutionized... ...the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts... ...Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers... ...to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School. Just one question, dear. You've been in this post how long, exactly? You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct? Yes. But you were unsuccessful? Obviously. Could you please predict something for me? I'm sorry? Move those mouths. One teensy little prophecy? Pity. No, wait. Wait, no. I think I do see something. Yes, I do. Something dark. You are in grave danger. Lovely. Cho. What's going on? It's Professor Trelawney. Sixteen years I've lived and taught here. Hogwarts is my home. You can't do this. Actually, I can. Something you'd like to say? Oh, there are several things I would like to say. There... Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside? Sybil, dear. This way. Thank you. Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms... ...of Educational Decree Number 23, as enacted by the minister... You have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds. That power remains with the headmaster. For now. Don't you all have studying to do? Professor. Professor? Professor Dumbledore. Professor! Professor Dumbledore. That foul, evil, old gargoyle. We're not learning how to defend ourselves. We're not learning how to pass our OWLs. She's taking over the entire school. Security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority. Furthermore, we have convincing evidence... ...that these disappearances are the work... ...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black. Harry. Sirius. - What are you doing here? - Answering your letter. You said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing? Training you to kill half-breeds? - She's not letting us use magic at all. - Well, I'm not surprised. The latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat. Combat? What does he think, we're forming some sort of wizard army? That's exactly what he thinks. That Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry. He's becoming more paranoid by the minute. The others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry... ...but things aren't going at all well with the Order. Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn... ...and these disappearances are just how it started before. Voldemort is on the move. Well, what can we do? Someone's coming. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. But for now, at least, it looks like you're on your own. He really is out there, isn't he? We've got to be able to defend ourselves. And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will. Harry. This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me? I'm a nutter, remember? Look on the bright side: You can't be any worse than old toad face. - Thanks, Ron. - I'm here for you, mate. Who's supposed to be meeting us, then? Just a couple of people. Lovely spot. Thought it would be safer off the beaten track. Matey, come back here. Hi. So you all know why we're here. We need a teacher. A proper teacher. One who's had experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts. - Why? - Why? Because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot. - So he says. - So Dumbledore says. So Dumbledore says because he says. The point is, where's the proof? If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed... I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here, clear out now. Come on, Hermione. They're here because they think I'm some freak. Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm? Yes. I've seen it. Blimey, Harry. I didn't know you could do that. And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office. It's true. Third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once. Last year, he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh. Wait. Look, it all sounds great when you say it like that... ...but the truth is, most of that was just luck. I didn't know what I was doing half the time. I nearly always had help. - He's just being modest. - No, Hermione, I'm not. Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow. But out there... ...when you're a second away from being murdered... ...or watching a friend die right before your eyes... You don't know what that's like. You're right, Harry, we don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're going to have any chance at beating... ...Voldemort... He's really back. Right. First we need to find a place to practice... ...where Umbridge won't find out. - The Shrieking Shack. - It's too small. - Forbidden Forest? - Not bloody likely. Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out? Who cares? I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules? Who are you and what have you done with Hermione? Anyway, at least we know one positive thing that came from today. What's that? Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she? Right. Over the next few days, we should each come up... ...with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice. We've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us. Will do, Harry. All student organizations are henceforth disbanded. Any student in noncompliance will be expelled. Watch where you're going, Longbottom. You've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement. The what? It's also known as the Come and Go Room. The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it. And it's always equipped for the seeker's needs. So say you really needed the toilet... Charming, Ronald. But, yes, that is the general idea. It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back. Expelliarmus. I'm hopeless. You're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus. You will please copy the approved text four times... ...to ensure maximum retention. - There will be no need to talk. - No need to think's more like it. - Expelliarmus. - Wands away. Stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal. It's a wizard's bread and butter, really. So come on, then, Nigel. Give it your best shot. Stupefy! Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done. Don't worry. I'll go easy on you. Thanks, Ronald. - Come on, Ron. - Come on, Ron. - You can do it. - Come on, Ron. - One Sickle. - You're on. Stupefy. - Thank you. - Shut up. I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it? It was completely intentional. Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea? Now, focus on a fixed point and try again. Expelliarmus. Very good. Keep your concentration. Great. A little higher. I'm okay. I'm okay. - Stupefy. - Stupefy. Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... ...may sign up in the high inquisitor's office. Diminuendo. Working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more: Believing in yourself. - Expelliarmus. - Levicorpus. Got it. Think of it this way. Every great wizard in history has started out... ...as nothing more than what we are now: Students. If they can do it, why not us? - Stupefy. - Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Reducto. - Expelliarmus. - Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man. So that's it for this lesson. Now, we're not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays. So just keep practicing on your own as best you can. And well done, everyone. Great, great work. Well done, mate. Thanks. See you after Christmas. See you in the Common Room, Harry. - Thanks a lot, Harry. - No worries. - Thank you so much. - Not at all. Merry Christmas. - Thank you, Harry. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Have a good Christmas. - Have a great Christmas, Luna. - We've been thinking. We could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles. Or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus-filled boils... Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me? Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day. Yeah. I'm okay. Anyway, it's worth it. It's just, learning all this... ...makes me wonder whether, if he'd known it... Cedric did know this stuff. He was really good. It's just, Voldemort was better. You're a really good teacher, Harry. I've never been able to stun anything before. Mistletoe. Probably full of Nargles, though. What are Nargles? No idea. Well, how was it? Wet. I mean, she was sort of crying. That bad at it, are you? I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory. Cho spends half her time crying these days. You'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up. Don't you understand how she must be feeling? Well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric... ...and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him... ...conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry... ...and frightened of failing her OWLs because she's worrying about everything. One person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode. Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon... Harry. Voldemort may be after something. Something he didn't have last time. Harry. Harry. In the dream, were you standing next to the victim... ...or looking down at the scene? Neither. It was like I... Will you please just tell me what's happening? Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight. Make sure he's found by the right people. - Sir. - Phineas. You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured... ...and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey. They've got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it. What's more, the Dark Lord failed to acquire it. Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to... Look at me! What's happening to me? You wished to see me, headmaster? Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning. Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable. It appears there's a connection... ...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own. Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear. Pray he remains ignorant. You mean, if he knows about it, then... ...he'll be able to read my mind? - Read it, control it... ...unhinge it. In the past, it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure... ...to invade the minds of his victims... ...creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony... ...only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally... ...kill them. Used properly, the power of Occlumency... ...will help shield you from access or influence. In these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind. You will attempt to resist. Prepare yourself. Legilimens. Concentrate, Potter. Focus. Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. Here we go. Daddy's back. Sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents. - And a nice big box for Ron. - Big box for you. And... Fred and George. Come on, open up. - I want to see your faces. - Yes. - Try it on. - Thanks, Mum. It's perfect. - Just what he wanted, actually. - Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum. Come on, then, everybody. Let's clear this away. Oh, Harry, Harry. There you are. - Happy Christmas. - Thank you. - Lovely to have you with us. - Thank you. Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy. - Thank you. - Has everybody got? Fred? George? - Hermione. - A Christmas toast. To Mr. Harry Potter... ...without whom I would not be here. - Harry. - Harry. Harry. That is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that. Daddy, don't forget last Christmas. I can't understand why you don't want to wear it, Ronald. I look like a bloody idiot, that's why. No more than usual, Ron. I don't know why... Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass. Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord. Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike. - If my poor mistress only knew... - Kreacher! That's enough of your bile. Away with you! Of course, master. Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black. Sorry about that. He never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy. Not to me, anyway. What, you grew up here? This is my parents' house. I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order. About the only useful thing I've been able to do. This is the Black family tree. My deranged cousin. I hated the lot of them. My parents with their pure-blood mania. My mother did that after I ran away. Charming woman. I was 16. Where did you go? Round your dad's. I was always welcome at the Potters'. I see him so much in you, Harry. You are so very much alike. I'm not so sure. Sirius, when I was... When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching. I was the snake. And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office... ...there was a moment when I wanted to... This connection between me and Voldemort. What if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him? I just feel so angry all the time. And what if, after everything that I've been through... ...something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad? I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You're not a bad person. You're a very good person who bad things have happened to. You understand? Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. Harry, time to go. When all this is over, we'll be a proper family. You'll see. Come on. Really? Harry. Harry. Hagrid's back. I'm sorry. I will say this one last time. I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been. I told you. I've been away for me health. - Your health? - Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know. Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by. If I were you, I shouldn't get too used to being back. In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all. This is top-secret, right? Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants. Giants? You found them? Well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see? I tried to convince them to join the cause. But I wasn't the only one that was trying to win them over. - Death Eaters? - Yes. Trying to persuade them to join You-Know-Who. - Did they? - I gave them Dumbledore's message. Suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose. And they did this to you? Not exactly, no. Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog. It's changing out there. Just like last time. There's a storm coming, Harry. We'd all best be ready when she does. We have confirmed that 10 high-security prisoners... ...in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape. And of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger. We strongly suspect... ...that the breakout was engineered... ...by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban... ...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black... ...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange. Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen. He's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth. Harry. I wanted to apologize. Now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up. So, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you. Neville? Fourteen years ago... ...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange... ...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She tortured them for information... ...but they never gave in. I'm quite proud to be their son. But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet. We're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise. Make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember. Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus. George, your turn now. Expecto Patronum. A full-bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce... ...but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents. Wow, that was really good. Fantastic, Ginny. Just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused. So focus, Luna. Think of the happiest thing you can. Expecto Patronum. - I'm trying. - I know. It's good. This is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well. Expecto Patronum. I'll make short work of this. Bombarda Maxima. Get them. Been watching them for weeks. And see, ""Dumbledore's Army""... ...proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius. All your fear-mongering about You-Know-Who... ...never fooled us for a minute. We saw your lies for what they were: A smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry. Naturally. No, professor. He had nothing to do with it. It was me. Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out... ...the parchment clearly says ""Dumbledore's Army,"" not ""Potter's."" I instructed Harry to form this organization. And I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities. Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet. If we hurry, we should still make the morning edition. Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore... ...to Azkaban... ...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition. I thought we might hit this little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I'm going to... What was the phrase? Come quietly. Well, I can tell you this: I have no intention of going to Azkaban. Enough of this. Take him. Well, you may not like him, minister... ...but you can't deny... ...Dumbledore has got style. Boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other. Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... Students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities. Any student in noncompliance will be expelled. Harry. You did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag. Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming. Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours. Yeah, we talked you into it. Yeah, but I agreed. I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is make things worse. Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore. Because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much. And the more you care, the more you have to lose. - So maybe it's just better to... - To what? To go it alone. Hagrid. Any idea where he's taking us? Hagrid, why can't you just tell us? I've never seen the centaurs so riled. And they're dangerous at the best of times. The Ministry restricts their territory much more... ...they'll have a full uprising on their hands. Hagrid, what's going on? I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three. I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone... ...I'll likely be getting the sack any day now. And I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him. Grawpy. Down here, you great buffoon. Grawpy. Brought you some company. I couldn't just leave him, because... Because he's my brother. Blimey. Well, half brother, really. He's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high-spirited, is all. - Grawpy, that is not polite. - Hagrid, do something. We talked about this. You do not grab, do you? That's your new friend, Hermione. Grawpy. Grawp. Put me down. Now. You all right? Fine. Just needs a firm hand, is all. I think you've got an admirer. You just stay away from her, all right? He gets his own food and all. It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone. You will look after him, won't you? I'm the only family he's got. Feeling sentimental? - That's private. - Not to me. And not to the Dark Lord, if you don't improve. Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you. You won't last two seconds if he invades your mind. You're just like your father. Lazy, arrogant. - Don't say a word against my father. - Weak. - I'm not weak. - Then prove it. Control your emotions. Discipline your mind. Legilimens. Harry. Sirius. I may vomit. Stop it. Is this what you call control? We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest. The Dark Lord isn't resting. You and Black, you're two of a kind. Sentimental children forever whining about how unfair your lives have been. Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair. Your blessed father knew that. In fact, he frequently saw to it. - My father was a great man. - Your father was a swine. - Legilimens. - Protego. Come on, Moony, Padfoot. Snape. Expelliarmus. Nice one, James. - Dad. - Impedimenta. Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy. Right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers? Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy. Enough. Enough. Your lessons are at an end. I... Get out. - What's your name? - Michael. Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael. Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See? It's fading already. You can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while. As I told you once before, Mr. Potter... ...naughty children deserve to be punished. You know, George... ...I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement. Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing. All right, professor! Here you go. Ready when you are. I need that prophecy. You'll have to kill me. Oh, I will. But first, you will fetch it for me. Crucio. Crucio. Sirius. Harry, are you sure? I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley. It's the door I've been dreaming about. I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before. Sirius said Voldemort was after something. Something he didn't have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries. Harry, please, just listen. What if Voldemort meant for you to see this? What if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you? What if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die? Hermione, he's the only family I've got left. What do we do? We'll have to use the Floo Network. Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance. Not all of them. Alohomora. Alert the Order if you can. - Are you mental? We're going with you. - It's too dangerous. When are you going to get it into your head? We're in this together. That you are. Caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl. You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you? - No. - Liar. - You sent for me, headmistress? - Snape, yes. The time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me or not. Have you brought the Veritaserum? I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students. The last of it on Miss Chang. Unless you wish to poison him... And I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did. I cannot help you. He's got Padfoot. He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden. Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What is he talking about, Snape? No idea. Very well. You give me no choice, Potter. As this is an issue of Ministry security... ...you leave me with... ...no alternative. The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue. That's illegal. What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him. Tell her, Harry! Tell me what? Well, if you won't tell her where it is... ...I will. Where what is? Dumbledore's secret weapon. How much further? Not far. It had to be somewhere students wouldn't find it accidentally. What are you doing? Improvising. Well? Where is this weapon? There isn't one, is there? You were trying to trick me. You know... ...I really hate children. You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter. Lower your weapons. I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence... Protego. How dare you? Filthy half-breed. Incarcerous. Please. Please stop it. Please. Now, enough. I will have order. You filthy animal. Do you know who I am? Leave him alone. It's not his fault. No, he doesn't understand. Potter, do something. Tell them I mean no harm. I'm sorry, professor. But I must not tell lies. What are you doing? I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge. Let me go! Thank you, Grawp. Hermione. Hermione, Sirius. - How'd you get away? - Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty. Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets. They told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves. That was clever, Ron. - Has been known to happen. - It was brilliant. So how are we getting to London? Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you... ...but I've got you into enough trouble as it is. Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real. Or was that all just words to you? Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate. So how are we going to get to London? We fly, of course. Department of Mysteries. This is it. Ninety-two. Ninety-three. Ninety-four. Ninety-five. - He should be here. - Harry. It's got your name on it. The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal... ...but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not. For neither can live while the other survives. Harry. Where's Sirius? You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams... ...and reality. You saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now, hand me the prophecy. If you do anything to us, I'll break it. He knows how to play. Itty, bitty baby. Potter. Bellatrix Lestrange. Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad? Better, now they're about to be avenged. Now, let's everybody just calm down... ...shall we? All we want is that prophecy. Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this? You dare speak his name? You filthy half-blood! It's all right. He's just a curious lad, aren't you? Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made. Which is lucky for you, really. Haven't you always wondered... ...the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord? Why he was unable to kill you... ...when you were just an infant? Don't you want to know the secret of your scar? All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand. All you have to do... ...is give it to me. Then I can show you everything. I've waited 14 years. I know. I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy. Stupefy. Levicorpus. Petrificus Totalus. Well done, Neville. Stupefy. - Stupefy. - Stupefy. Stupefy. Reducto. Get back to the door. Department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn't they? The voices. Can you tell what they're saying? There aren't any voices, Harry. Let's get out of here. I hear them too. Harry, it's just an empty archway. Please, Harry. Get behind me. Did you actually believe... ...or were you truly naive enough to think... ...that children stood a chance against us? I'll make this simple for you, Potter. Give me the prophecy now... ...or watch your friends die. Don't give it to him, Harry. Get away from my godson. Now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here. What? No, I'm staying with you. You've done beautifully. Now, let me take it from here. Black. Expelliarmus! Nice one, James. Avada Kedavra. No. No. I killed Sirius Black. - You coming to get me? - Crucio. You've got to mean it, Harry. She killed him. She deserves it. You know the spell, Harry. Do it. So weak. It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on their way. By which time I shall be gone, and you... ...shall be dead. You've lost, old man. Harry. So weak. So vulnerable. Look at me. Harry, it isn't how you are alike. It's how you are not. Harry? You're the weak one... ...and you'll never know love or friendship. And I feel sorry for you. You're a fool, Harry Potter. And you will lose everything. He's back. I know how you feel, Harry. No, you don't. It's my fault. No, the fault is mine. I knew it was only a matter of time... ...before Voldemort made the connection between you. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year... ...he'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected. The prophecy said: ""Neither one can live while the other one survives."" It means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end. Yes. Why didn't you tell me? For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. The same reason your friends saved you. After all these years, after all you've suffered... ...I didn't want to cause you any more pain. I cared too much about you. How come you're not at the feast? Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them. That's awful. Oh, it's all good fun. But as it's the last night, I really do need them back. Do you want any help finding them? I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry. Are you sure you don't want any help looking? That's all right. Anyway, my mum always said... ...the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding. I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me. What's that? That even though we've got a fight ahead of us... ...we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have. Yeah? Something worth fighting for.",0.38575568050146103,0.8546876907348633,0.7468962669372559,0.4751811232417822,0.508825957775116,0.5607954263687134
6 Harry,"I killed Sirius Black! He's back. The police are continuing with the investigation... ... into the cause of the Millennium Bridge disaster. Traffic has been halted as police search for survivors. The surrounding area remains closed. The mayor has urged Londoners to remain calm... ""Harry Potter."" Who's Harry Potter? Oh, no one. Bit of a tosser, really. Funny, that paper of yours. Couple nights ago, I could've sworn I saw a picture move. - Really? - Thought I was going around the twist. - Hey, I was wondering... - Eleven. That's when I get off. You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter. You've been reckless this summer, Harry. I like riding around on trains. Takes my mind off things. Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it? The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself. But now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm. Do as I say. I just Apparated, didn't I? Indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add. Most people vomit the first time. I can't imagine why. Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton. Harry, I assume, right about now, you're wondering why I brought you here. Am I right? Actually, sir, after all these years, I just sort of go with it. Wands out, Harry. Horace? Horace? Merlin's beard! No need to disfigure me, Albus. Well, I must say you make a very convincing armchair, Horace. It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away? Dragon's blood. - Oh. - Oh, yes, introductions. Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine... ...Horace Slughorn. Horace... ...well, you know who this is. Harry Potter. What's with all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't, by any chance, waiting for someone else? Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean. All right, the Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year. Do you know what that's like? You can only say no so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week. Muggles who own this are in the Canary Islands. Well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Mind. That was fun. - Do you mind if I use the loo? - No, of course. Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus. The answer's still no. Absolutely and unequivocally, no. You're very like your father. - Except for the eyes. You have your... - My mother's eyes. Yeah. Lily. Lovely Lily. She was exceedingly bright, your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born. One of my best friends is Muggle-born. Best in our year. Please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no. Your mother was one of my absolute favorites. Look, there she is. Right at the front. All mine. Each and every one. Ex-students, I mean. You recognize Barnabas Cuffe, editor of The Daily Prophet. Always takes my owl, should I wish to register an opinion... ...on the news of the day. Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies. Free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time. Ah, yes. Regulus Black. You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago. I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius. It's a shame. Talented boy. I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set. Horace? Do you mind if I take this? - I do love knitting patterns. - Yes, of course. But you're not leaving? I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable. I would have considered it a personal triumph... ...had you consented to return to Hogwarts. Oh, well. You're like my friend Mr. Potter here, one of a kind. Well, bye-bye, Horace. Bye. All right. I'll do it. But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before. And I expect a raise. These are mad times we live in. Mad! They are indeed. Sir, exactly what was all that about? You are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is gonna try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel. That's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return. I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl. It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse. Oh, you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry. But, sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk? Both are waiting for you. Hedwig. Mum? Ginny, what is it? I was only wondering when Harry got here. - What? Harry? Harry who? - Harry Potter, of course. I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I? - His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl. - No, dear, I seriously doubt that. Harry? Did someone say ""Harry""? Me, nosy. Is he up there with you? Of course not. I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I? - Is that an owl? - You haven't seen him, have you? He's wandering about the house. - Really? - Really. Harry! Harry! Hello. What a lovely surprise. Why didn't you let us know you were coming? - I didn't know. Dumbledore. - Oh, that man. But then, what would we do without him? Got a bit of toothpaste. So when did you get here? A few days ago. Though for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming. Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts. That it's too dangerous. - Oh, come on. - She's not alone. Even my parents, and they're Muggles, know something bad's happening. Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy... ...and it took a few days, but she came around. But this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer? There's been a lot of talk recently that... ...Dumbledore's got a bit old. Rubbish! Well, he's only... What is he? Hundred and fifty? Give or take a few years. Cissy! You can't do this! He can't be trusted! The Dark Lord trusts him. - The Dark Lord's mistaken. - Pfft. Run along, Wormtail. I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this. If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak. Put it down, Bella. We mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa. You? The Dark Lord told you? Your sister doubts me. Understandable. Over the years I've played my part well. So well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time. Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it. I don't doubt you, Severus. You should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco. He's just a boy. I can't change the Dark Lord's mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco. - Severus. - Swear to it. Make the Unbreakable Vow. It's just empty words. He'll give it his best effort. But when it matters most... ...he'll just slither back into his hole. Coward. Take out your wand. Will you... ...Severus Snape... ...watch over Draco Malfoy... ...as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes? I will. And will you, to the best of your ability... ...protect him from harm? I will. And if Draco should fail... ...will you yourself carry out the deed... ...the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform? I will. Step up! Step up! We've got Fainting Fancies! Nosebleed Nougats! - And just in time for school... - Puking Pastilles! - Into the cauldron, handsome. - Into the cauldron, handsome. I will have order! I really hate children. I will have order! I really hate children. I will have order! - Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. - A real money spinner, that. Handy if you need to make a quick getaway. - Hello, ladies. - Hello, ladies. - Love potions, eh? - Yeah, they really do work. Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own. Meaning? Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas? It's none of your business. How much for this? - Five Galleons. - Five Galleons. - How much for me? - Five Galleons. I'm your brother. - Ten Galleons. - Ten Galleons. Come on, let's go. Hi, Ron. Hi. How are Fred and George doing it? Half the Alley's closed down. Fred reckons people need a laugh these days. I reckon he's right. Oh, no. Everyone got their wands from Ollivander's. Harry? Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy look like two people... ...who don't want to be followed? Quibbler. Quibbler. He's lovely. They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. - Quibbler? - Oh, please. - What's a Wrackspurt? - They're invisible creatures. They float in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler. So, what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet? And who were all those people? Don't you see? It was a ceremony, an initiation. Stop it, Harry. I know where you're going. It's happened. He's one of them. One of what? Harry is under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater. You're barking. What would You-Know-Who want with Malfoy? Well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture? It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke. Look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense. Hermione saw it with her own eyes. I told you, I don't know what I saw. I need some air. Don't worry. When we get to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out. - What was that? Blaise? - Don't know. Relax, boys. It's probably just a first-year messing around. Come on, Draco. Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon. Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school. I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower... ...if I had to continue for another two years. What's that supposed to mean? Let's just say you won't see me wasting my time in Charms class next year. Amused, Blaise? We'll see just who's laughing in the end. You two go on. I wanna check something. Where's Harry? He's probably already on the platform. Come on. Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus. Oh, yeah... ...she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. That's for my father. Enjoy your ride back to London. Finite. - Hello, Harry. - Luna! - How'd you know where I was? - Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them. Sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna. That's all right. It was like being with a friend. Oh, I am your friend, Luna. That's nice. About time. I've been looking all over for you two. Right. Names? Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years. No exceptions, Potter. Who are those people? Aurors. For security. What's this cane here, then? It's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick. And what exactly would you be wanting with a...? Could be construed as an offensive weapon. It's all right, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy. Nice face, Potter. Would you like me to fix it for you? Personally, I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way... ...but it's up to you. Well, have you ever fixed a nose before? No, but I've done several toes, and how different are they, really? Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go. - Episkey. - Ah! - How do I look? - Exceptionally ordinary. Brilliant. Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute. Will you stop eating? Your best friend is missing! Oi. Turn around, you lunatic. He's covered in blood again. - Why is it he's always covered in blood? - Looks like it's his own this time. Where have you been? - What happened to your face? - Later. What've I missed? Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times. Easy for it to say, huh? It's a hat, isn't it? Very best of evenings to you all. Thanks. First off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff... ...Horace Slughorn. Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say... ...has agreed to resume his old post as Potions Master. Meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts... ...will be taken by Professor Snape. Snape? Now, as you know... ...each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight. And you have the right to know why. Once there was a young man, who, like you... ...sat in this very hall... ...walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roof. He seemed to all the world a student like any other. His name? Tom Riddle. Today, of course... ...he's known all over the world by another name. Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight... ...I'm reminded of a sobering fact. Every day, every hour... ...this very minute, perhaps... ...dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls. But in the end, their greatest weapon is you. Just something to think about. Now, off to bed. Pip-pip. That was cheerful. History of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down. Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies! That is the girls' lavatory. Potter. Oh, this can't be good. Enjoying ourselves, are we? - I had a free period this morning. - So I noticed. I would think you would want to fill it with Potions. Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror? It was, but I was told I had to get an ""Outstanding"" in my O.W.L. So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students... ...with ""Exceeds Expectations."" Brilliant. Um... - Well, I'll head there straightaway. - Oh, good, good. Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there. I don't wanna take Potions. This is Quidditch trials coming up. I need to practice. Attention to detail in the preparation... ...is the prerequisite of all planning. Ah. Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry. We've brought someone with us, I see. Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace, actually. - I'm gonna... - Nonsense, we'll sort you out. Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out. I haven't actually got my book yet, and nor has Ron. Get what you want from the cupboard. Now, as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning. Any ideas what these might be? - Yes, Miss...? - Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum. And that would be Polyjuice Potion. It's terribly tricky to make. And this is Amortentia... ...the most powerful love potion in the world. It's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them. For example, I smell... ...freshly mown grass, and new parchment, and... ...spearmint toothpaste. Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible. But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room. Sir? You haven't told us what's in that one. Oh, yes. What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen... ...is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as... - Liquid luck. - Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck. Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong. One sip and you will find that all of your endeavors succeed. At least until the effects wear off. So this is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour that remains... ...manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death... ...the recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books. I should point out, however, only once did a student manage to brew a potion... ...of sufficient quality to claim this prize. Nevertheless, good luck to you all. Let the brewing commence. How did you do that? You crush it. Don't cut it. No. The instructions specifically say to cut. No, really. Merlin's beard! It is perfect. So perfect I daresay one drop would kill us all. So here we are, then, as promised. One vial of Felix Felicis. Congratulations. Use it well. Harry, you got my message. Come in. How are you? I'm fine, sir. Enjoying your classes? I know Professor Slughorn is most impressed with you. I think he overestimates my abilities, sir. Do you? Definitely. What about your activities outside the classroom? - Sir? - Well, I notice you spend... ...a great deal of time with Miss Granger. I can't help wondering... Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant, and we're friends, but, no. Forgive me. I was merely being curious. But enough chitchat. You must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight. The answer lies here. What you are looking at are memories. In this case, pertaining to one individual, Voldemort... ...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle. This vial contains the most particular memory... ...of the day I first met him. I'd like you to see it, if you would. I admit some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. There have been incidents with the other children. Nasty things. Tom, you have a visitor. How do you do, Tom? Don't. - You're the doctor, aren't you? - No. I am a professor. I don't believe you. She wants me looked at. They think I'm different. Well, perhaps they're right. I'm not mad. Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. Hogwarts is a school. A school of magic. You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things other children can't. I can make things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me. I can make them hurt... ...if I want. Who are you? Well, I'm like you, Tom. I'm different. Prove it. I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom. Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom. At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it. You understand me? I can speak to snakes too. They find me. Whisper things. Is that normal for someone like me? Did you know, sir? Then? Did I know I'd just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No. If I had, I... Over time, while here at Hogwarts... ...Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher. Can you guess who that teacher might be? You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you? No, I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not give it up easily. You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me. I did. Do you want me to let him? Yes. All right. Um... This morning, I'm gonna be putting you all through a few drills... ...just to assess your strengths. Quiet! Please! Shut it! Thanks. All right. Um... Just because you made the team last year... ...does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear? Good. No hard feelings, Weasley, all right? Hard feelings? Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well. It's nothing personal. Really? Strapping guy like you? You've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think? Keepers need to be quick, agile. Oh, I like my chances. Say, think you could introduce me to your friend Granger? Wouldn't mind getting on a first-name basis, know what I mean? Come on, Weasley! - Come on, Ron! - Go on, Weasley! - Go on, Weasley! - Yeah, Ron! Go on, Cormac! Come on, Ron! Come on, Ron. Come on, Ron. Confundus. Isn't he brilliant? I have to admit, I thought I was gonna miss that last one. I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard. He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac. He's vile. Have you ever heard of this spell? Sectumsempra? No, I haven't. And if you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in. Not bloody likely. He's top of the class. He's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius. What? I'd like to know whose that book was. Let's have a look. No. Why not? The binding is fragile. - The binding is fragile? - Yeah. - Who's the Half-Blood Prince? - Who? That's what it says right here: ""This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince."" For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... ... yet you have no desire to find out who he is? I didn't say I wasn't curious, and I don't sleep with it. Well, it's true. I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now all you do is read that bloody book. It's just like being with Hermione. Well, I was curious, so I went to... - The library. - The library. And? And nothing. I couldn't find a reference anywhere to a Half-Blood Prince. - There we go. That settles it, then. - Filius! I was hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks! No, emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace. Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer? A chum of mine was sledging down Claxby Hill. We had a very long, homemade, Norwegian-style sledge... No, not there. Over here. No, sit beside me. Okay. Something to drink? Three Butterbeers, and some ginger in mine, please. Oh, bloody hell. Slick git. Honestly, Ronald, they're only holding hands. And snogging. - I'd like to leave. - What? You can't be serious. - That happens to be my sister. - So? What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? You expect her to leave? - Hey, my boy! - Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you. And you, and you. So, what brings you here? The Three Broomsticks and I go way back, further than I care to admit. I can remember when it was One Broomstick. All hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days... ...I used to throw together the occasional supper party... ...for the select student or two. - Would you be game? - I'd consider it an honor, sir. You would be welcome too, Granger. - I'd be delighted, sir. - Splendid. Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby. What are you playing at? Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him. - Get to know him? - I don't know. It must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask. Got a little bit... Katie, you don't know what it could be. - Harry. - What? Did you hear what she said back at the pub about me and her snogging? As if. I warned her. I warned her not to touch it. Don't get any closer. Get back, all of you. Do not touch that, except by the wrappings. Do you understand? You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession... ...when she entered the Three Broomsticks? It's like I said. She left to go to the loo, and when she came back she had the package. She said it was important that she deliver it. - Did she say to whom? - To Professor Dumbledore. Very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go. Why is it when something happens it is always you three? Believe me, professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years. McGONAGALL: Oh, Severus. What do you think? I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive. She was cursed, wasn't she? I know Katie. Off the pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly. If she was delivering that to Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly. Yes, she was cursed. It was Malfoy. That is a very serious accusation, Potter. Indeed. - Your evidence? - I just know. You just... ...know. You astonish with your gifts, Potter. Gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing. How grand it must be to be the Chosen One. I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you. What do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny? Well, what does she see in him? Dean? He's brilliant. You called him a slick git not five hours ago. Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he? Something snaps, and you've gotta hate him, you know? On principle. I suppose. - So, what is it he sees in her? - I don't know. She's smart, funny. - Attractive. - Attractive? - You know, she's got nice skin. - Skin? Dean dates my sister because of her skin? Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor. Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean. I've never really thought about it. But, I suppose, yeah. Very nice. - I think I'll be going to sleep now. - Right. Yeah. So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your Uncle Tiberius these days? Yes, sir. In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him... ...and the Minister for Magic over the holidays. Well, be sure to give them both my best. What about your uncle, Belby? For those who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion. - Is he working on anything new? - Don't know. Him and Dad don't get on. Probably because me dad says potions are rubbish. Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day. What about you, Miss Granger? What does your family do in the Muggle world? My parents are dentists. They tend to people's teeth. Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession? No. Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did bite my father once. He needed 10 stitches. Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in. Look at her eyes. They've been fighting again, her and Dean. Sorry. I'm not usually late. No matter. You're just in time for dessert, that is, if Belby's left you any. What? Nothing. Goodbye. Bye-bye. - Potter. - I'm sorry, sir. I was just admiring your hourglass. Oh, yes. A most intriguing object. The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation. If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly. - If it is not... - I think I'll be going. Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, dear boy. As to some of your classmates... ...well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf. The shelf, sir? Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here. But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry? Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? You knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle? You were his teacher. Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst here at Hogwarts. What was he like? I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents. Of course. It's only natural you should want to know more. But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet... ...albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard. Not unlike others I've known. Not unlike yourself, in fact. If the monster existed... ...it was buried deep within. Good luck, eh, Ron. - Nice hat! - Ron, you're a loser. I'm counting on you, Ron. I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah? - Looking good, Ron. - Loser! What's he wearing? So how was it, then? - How was what? - Your dinner party? Pretty boring, actually. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert. Slughorn's having a Christmas do, you know. And we're meant to bring someone. I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, isn't he? - Actually, I was going to ask you. - Really? Good luck today, Ron. I know you'll be brilliant. I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot. Have it your way. - Juice? - Sure. Hello, everyone. You look dreadful, Ron. Is that why you put something in his cup? Is it a tonic? Liquid luck. Don't drink it, Ron. - You could be expelled for that. - I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, Harry. We've got a game to win. Yes! Go on, Ron! Do it! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Yes! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Whoo! Yes. Whoo! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! You really shouldn't have done it. I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm. That was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game. You didn't put it in. Ron only thought you did. Charms spell. I'm just practicing. Well, they're really good. How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? I know. I see the way you look at her. You're my best friend. Oops. I think this room's taken. What's with the birds? Oppugno. It feels like this. Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist. What Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it. It's chemical. Will it last? Who knows? Point is, I'm a free agent. He's at perfect liberty to kiss whoever he likes. I really couldn't care less. Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party? Yes. Now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements. Have you? Yes. Why? I just thought, seeing as neither of us can go with who we'd really like to... ...we should go together, as friends. Why didn't I think of that? Who are you going with? Um, it's a surprise. Anyway, it's you we've got to worry about. You can't just take anyone. See that girl over there? That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's trying to smuggle you a love potion. Really? Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One. But I am the Chosen One. Okay, sorry. Um, kidding. I'll ask someone I like. Someone cool. I've never been to this part of the castle. At least not while awake. I sleepwalk, you see. That's why I wear shoes to bed. Harmonia Nectere Passus. Harmonia Nectere Passus. Harmonia Nectere Passus. Drink? Neville. I didn't get into the Slug Club. It's okay, though. He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo. - Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks. - Okay. Hermione. What are you doing? And what happened to you? I've just escaped. I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe. Cormac? That's who you invited? I thought it would annoy Ron the most. Thank you. I'll catch up with you later. He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant. - Dragon tartare? - No, I'm fine. Thank you. Just as well. They give one horribly bad breath. On second thoughts... Might keep Cormac at bay. Oh, God, here he comes. I think she just went to powder her nose. Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she? What is this I'm eating, by the way? Dragon balls. You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen. Not so quick, Potter. Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date... Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two. Besides, I only wish to convey a message. - A message? - From Professor Dumbledore. He asked me to give you his best, and he hopes you enjoy your holiday. You see... ...he's traveling, and he won't return until term resumes. Traveling where? Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib! Professor Slughorn, sir. I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party. Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy? I'll escort him out. Certainly, professor. All right, everyone, carry on, carry on. Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What's it to you? I swore to protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow. I don't need protection. I was chosen for this. Out of all others. Me. - And I won't fail him. - You're afraid, Draco. You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you. No! I was chosen. This is my moment. ""Unbreakable Vow."" You're sure that's what Snape said? Positive. Why? Well, it's just you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. You don't understand. Oh, bloody hell. I miss you. Lovely. All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look. I'll take your word for it. So, what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow? You die. Wait, the pudding's still here. Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission? I know it sounds mad. Has it occurred to you Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help... ...so he could find out what he was up to? - That's not what it sounded like. - Perhaps Harry's right. To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's... It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgment. - Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do. - Dumbledore can make mistakes. You're blinded by hatred. - I'm not. - Yes, you are. People are disappearing, Harry, daily. We place our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed. Open up, you. Don't you trust me? It's good. Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah. - Pie? - Not for me, no. You'll have to forgive Remus. It takes its toll, his condition. Are you all right, Mr. Weasley? We're being followed, all of us. Most days, Molly doesn't leave the house. It's not been easy. Did you get my owl? Yes, I did. If Dumbledore's traveling, then that's news to the Ministry... ...but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it. As for Draco Malfoy... ...I know a bit more. - Go on. - I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes. I think, from what you described... ...what you and Ron saw in summer... ...the object that Draco is so interested in... ...is a vanishing cabinet. A vanishing cabinet? They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can see the appeal. Should Death Eaters come knocking... ...one simply had to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two. They can transport you anywhere. Tricky contraptions though, very temperamental. What happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes? Nothing. It's still there. It was delicious, Molly, really. Are you sure you won't stay? No, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst. Remus? Sweetheart. Has Ron gone to bed? Um... Not yet. No. Shoelace. Merry Christmas, Harry. Merry Christmas. - Harry, no! - Remus! Ginny! I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black! You coming to get me? Harry, can you get me? You coming to get me? Harry? Stupefy! Harry! Ginny! Molly. It's easy for them to get to you. You're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realize who you are, Harry. I know who I am, Hermione, all right? Sorry. Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it. That's my Won-Won. Excuse me, I have to go and vomit. I'd like to know where you get your information. More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. Sir... ...is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring? Now, Tom. I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? By the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite. But how did you know? Intuition. Gracious. Is it that time already? Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention. Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours. - Is something on your mind, Tom? - Yes, sir. You see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to. The other professors, well, they're not like you. They might misunderstand. Go on. I was in the library the other night... ...in the Restricted Section... ...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic. And I thought perhaps you could illuminate me. It's called, as I understand it... I beg your pardon? I don't know anything about such things, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you! Now, get out of here at once, and don't let me ever catch you mentioning it again! Confused? I'd be surprised if you weren't. Well, I don't understand. What happened? This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected. It is also a lie. This memory has been tampered with... ...by the same person whose memory it is, our old friend, Professor Slughorn. But why would he tamper with his own memory? - I suspect he's ashamed of it. - Why? Why, indeed? I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn, and you have done so. Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory... ...any way you can. I don't know him that well, sir. This memory is everything. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must not fail. So I'd highly recommend you reacquaint yourself... ...with the chapter on antidotes. I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go. Alys, don't forget your rat tail. Aha. If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself. To what do I owe this pleasure? Sir, I wondered if I might ask you something. Ask away, dear boy, ask away. The other day I was in the library, in the Restricted Section... ...and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic. Yes. And what was this rare piece of magic? Well, I don't know. I can't remember the name exactly. It got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us? I'm Potions Master, Harry. I think your question'd better be posed to Professor Snape. Yes. Um... He and I don't exactly see eye to eye, sir. What I mean to say is... ...well, he's not like you. He might misunderstand. Yes. There can be no light without the dark. And so it is with magic. Myself, I always strive to live within the light. I suggest you do the same. Is that what you told Tom Riddle, when he came asking questions? Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he? Didn't he? Yes? Oh, it's you, Potter. I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment. It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon. Divine. Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we? It was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one. - Or 20. - I can't stop thinking about her, Harry. Honestly, I reckoned she was annoying you. She could never annoy me. I think I love her. Well, brilliant. Do you think she knows I exist? I hope so. She's been snogging you for three months. Snogging? Who are you talking about? Who are you talking about? Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane. Okay, very funny. - What was that for? - It's no joke! I'm in love with her! Fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her? No. Can you introduce me? Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you to Romilda Vane. I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential. Where's Romilda? What's the matter with Wenby? Very powerful love potion. Very well. Better bring him in. I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry. Well, I thought this called for a more practiced hand, sir. Hello, darling. Fancy a drink? Perhaps you're right. I'm sorry, by the way, professor, about earlier today, our misunderstanding. Oh, not at all. All water under the bridge, you know? Correct? I expect you're tired of it after all these years. All the questions about Voldemort. Don't use that name. There you are, old boy. Bottoms up. - What's this? - Tonic for the nerves. - What happened to me? - Love potion. A bloody strong one at that. - I feel really bad. - You need a pick-me-up. Got Butterbeer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead. I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances... Here we are, Potter. To life! Ron. Ron. Professor, do something. I don't understand. Come on, Ron, breathe. These girls, they're gonna kill me. Quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar. You must be very proud of your student, Horace. Hm? Oh, yes, very proud. I think we agree, Potter's actions were heroic. The question is, why were they necessary? Why, indeed? This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't remember who gave you this bottle? Which, by the way, possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry... ...when not polluted with poison. Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself. To whom, I might ask? To you, Headmaster. Where is he? Where's my Won-Won? Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here? I might ask you the same question. I happen to be his girlfriend. I happen to be his friend. Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks. I suppose you want to make up now that he's all interesting. He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting. Ah. See? He senses my presence. Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here. I'm here. Uh... Hermione... Hermione. Hermione. Oh, to be young, and to feel love's keen sting. Well, come away, everybody. Mr. Weasley is well tended. About time, don't you think? Thank you. Oh, shut up. Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow. Tell me how I broke up with Lavender again. Um, well... ...she came to visit you in the hospital. And you talked. I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation. Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her. It's just she seems a bit put out. Yes, she does, doesn't she? You say you don't remember anything from that night? Anything at all? There is something. But it can't be. I was completely boggled, wasn't I? Right. Boggled. Harry. That's Katie. Katie Bell. Katie. How are you? I know you're going to ask, Harry, but I don't know who cursed me. I've been trying to remember, honestly. But I just can't. Katie? I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you? Sectumsempra! Vulnera Sanentur. Vulnera Sanentur. Vulnera Sanentur. You have to get rid of it. Today. Take my hand. The Room of Requirement. We need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book... ...where no one will ever find it, including you. - What was that? - What was that? See? You never know what you'll find up here. All right, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted. Close your eyes. That can stay hidden up here too, if you like. So did you and Ginny do it, then? What? You know, hide the book? Oh, yeah. Ah. Dear, yes. Still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it? Luck. That's it. All I need's a bit of luck. Well, how do you feel? Excellent. Really excellent. Remember... ...Slughorn usually eats early... ...takes a walk, and then returns to his office. Right. - I'm going down to Hagrid's. - What? No, Harry, you've got to go and speak to Slughorn. - We have a plan. - I know... ...but I've got a good feeling about Hagrid's. I feel it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean? - No. - Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing. Or Felix does. Hi! Merlin's beard, Harry! Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat, coughed. You probably feared I was Professor Sprout. Yes, I did, actually. What makes you think that? Well, just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around, the jumping when you saw me. Are those Tentacula leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they? Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer. Not that I'm familiar with any such transactions, but one does hear rumors. My own interests are purely academic, of course. Personally, these plants always kind of freaked me out. How did you get out of the castle, Harry? Through the front door, sir. I'm off to Hagrid's. He's a very dear friend... ...and I fancied paying him a visit. So if you don't mind, I will be going now. Harry! - Sir? - It's nearly nightfall. Surely you realize I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself. Well, then, by all means, come along, sir. Harry, I must insist you accompany me... ...back to the castle immediately! That would be counterproductive, sir. And what makes you say that? No idea. Horace. Merlin's beard. Is that an actual Acromantula? A dead one, I think, sir. Good God. Dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it? Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was. - I'm so sorry, I didn't... - Don't worry yourself, you're not alone. Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are. It's the eyes, I reckon. They unnerve some folk. Not to mention the pincers. Yeah, I reckon that too. Hagrid, the last thing I wish to be is indelicate... ...but Acromantular venom is uncommonly rare. Would you allow me to extract a vial or two? Purely for academic purposes, you understand. Well, I don't suppose it's going to do him much good now, is it? My thoughts exactly. Always have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occasions as this. Old Potions Master's habit, you know. I wish you could've seen him in his prime. Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent. Oh, dear. - Would you like me to say a few words? - Yes. He had a family, I trust? Oh, yeah. Farewell... Aragog. Farewell, Aragog... ...king of the arachnids. Your body will decay... ...but your spirit lingers on. And your human friends find solace in the loss they have sustained. I had him from an egg, you know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. No bigger than a Pekinese. A Pekinese, mind you. How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me. One afternoon I came downstairs, and he'd vanished. Poof. - That's very odd, isn't it? - It is, isn't it? But that's life, I suppose. You go along and then suddenly, poof! - Poof. - Poof. It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk... ...with just a few inches of clear water in it. And floating on the surface was a flower petal. As I watched, it sank. Just before it reached the bottom... ...it transformed... ...into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic. Wondrous to behold. The flower petal had come from a lily. Your mother. The day I came downstairs... ...the day the bowl was empty... ...was the day your mother... I know why you're here. But I can't help you. It would ruin me. Do you know why I survived, professor? The night I got this? Because of her. Because she sacrificed herself. Because she refused to step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort. - Don't say his name. - I'm not afraid of the name, professor. I'm going to tell you something. Something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One. Only I can destroy him, but in order to do so... ...I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you years ago in your office... ...and I need to know what you told him. Be brave, professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise, you disgrace her. Otherwise, she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl will remain empty forever. Please, don't think badly of me when you see it. You've no idea what he was like, even then. I was in the library the other night... ...in the Restricted Section... ...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic. It's called, as I understand it... ...a Horcrux. - I beg your pardon? - Horcrux. I came across the term while reading... ...and I didn't fully understand it. I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom... ...but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed. Which is... ...why I came to you. A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul. But I don't understand how that works, sir. One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you're protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed. Protected? That part of your soul that is hidden lives on. In other words, you cannot die. And how does one split his soul, sir? I think you already know the answer to that, Tom. Murder. Yes. Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven...? Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces... This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic? Of course, sir. It'll be our little secret. Sir. This is beyond anything I imagined. You mean to say he succeeded, sir, in making a Horcrux? Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right. And not just once. What are they exactly? Could be anything. Most commonplace of objects. A ring, for example. Or a book. - Tom Riddle's diary. - It's a Horcrux, yes. Four years ago, when you saved Ginny's life... ...in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this. I knew this was a different kind of magic. Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight I had no idea just how powerful. - The ring? - Belonged to Voldemort's mother. Difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux... One destroys Voldemort. But how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere. True. But magic, especially dark magic... ...leaves traces. It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir? - When you leave the school? - Yes. And I think perhaps I may have found another. But this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone. Once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry. Have you ever considered that you ask too much... ...that you take too much for granted? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore? Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant. I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss. Oh, Harry. You need a shave, my friend. You know, at times, I forget how much you've grown. At times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I'm an old man. You still look the same to me, sir. Just like your mother, you're unfailingly kind. A trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid. The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous. I promised you could accompany me, and I stand by that promise. But there is one condition: You must obey every command I give you, without question. Yes, sir. You do understand what I'm saying? Should I tell you to hide, you hide. Should I tell you to run, you run. Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so. Your word, Harry. My word. Take my arm. Sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts. Well, being me has its privileges. This is the place. Oh, yes. This place has known magic. - Sir! - In order to gain passage... ...payment must be made. Payment intended to weaken any intruder. - You should've let me, sir. - No, Harry. Your blood's much more precious than mine. Voldemort will not have made it easy to discover his hiding place. He will have put certain defenses in position. Careful. There it is. The only question is, how do we get there? If you would, Harry. Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir? Oh, yes. It has to be drunk. All of it has to be drunk. You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me. Might make me forget why I'm here. Might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief. You are not to indulge these requests. It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion. Even if you have to force it down my throat. - Understood? - Why can't I drink it, sir? Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry. Professor. Professor! Harry. Professor, can you hear me? Professor. No. Don't. You have to keep drinking, like you said. Remember? - Stop. - It will stop. It will stop... ...but only if you keep drinking. - Please, don't make me. - I'm sorry, sir. - Please. - Kill me. Kill me! - No! It's my fault. It's all my fault. It's my fault. Just one more, sir. One more, and then I promise... ...I promise I'll do what you say. - I promise. - No. Please. Harry. Water. Water. Water. You did it, sir. Look. Harry. Water. Aguamenti. Water. Lumos. Lumos Maxima! Harry. Sectumsempra! Harry. - Stupefy! - Harry. Harry. Partis Temporus! Go to your houses. No dawdling. We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey. No. Severus. Severus is who I need. Wake him. Tell him what happened. Speak to no one else. Severus, Harry. Hide yourself below, Harry. Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission. Whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below. Harry, do as I say. Trust me. Trust me. Good evening, Draco. What brings you here on this fine spring evening? Who else is here? I heard you talking. I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. Have you been whispering to yourself, Draco? Draco... ...you are no assassin. - How do you know what I am? I've done things that would shock you. Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me? Replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison? Forgive me, Draco. I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak... ...your heart can't really have been in them. He trusts me. I was chosen. Then I shall make it easy for you. Expelliarmus! Very good. Very good. You're not alone. There are others. How? The vanishing cabinet in the Room of Requirement. - I've been mending it. - Let me guess. It has a sister. A twin. In Borgin and Burkes. They form a passage. Ingenious. Draco... ...years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. - Please let me help you. - I don't want your help! Don't you understand? I have to do this. I have to kill you. Or he's gonna kill me. Well, look what we have here. Well done, Draco. Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order, don't you? Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're all on a bit of a tight schedule. Do it. He doesn't have the stomach, just like his father. Let me finish him in my own way. No! The Dark Lord was clear, the boy is to do it. This is your moment. Do it. Go on, Draco. Now! No. Severus. Please. Avada Kedavra. Yeah! Hagrid! Hello? Snape! He trusted you! Go on. Incarcerous. Fight back! You coward, fight back! No! He belongs to the Dark Lord. Sectumsempra! You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? Yes. I'm the Half-Blood Prince. McGONAGALL: Potter... ...in light of what has happened... ...if you should have the need to talk to someone... You should know, Professor Dumbledore... ...you meant a great deal to him. Do you think he would've done it? Draco? No. No, he was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. And I did nothing. It's fake. Open it. ""To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this... ...but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match... ...you will be mortal once more. R.A.B."" R.A.B. Don't know. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. Which means it was all a waste. All of it. Ron's okay with it, you know. You and Ginny. But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum. I'm not coming back, Hermione. I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started. And I don't know where that'll lead me... ...but I'll let you and Ron know where I am when I can. I've always admired your courage, Harry. But sometimes, you can be really thick. You don't really think you're going to be able... ...to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry. I never realized how beautiful this place was.",0.247077114880085,0.5912264883518219,0.23626269679516554,0.03886039648205042,0.044180996948853135,0.31333209574222565
7 Harry,"These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has, perhaps, faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry: We, ever your servants... ...will continue to defend your liberty... ...and repel the forces that seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains... ...strong. Hermione. Tea's ready, darling. Coming, Mom. Come on, Dudley, hurry up. I still don't understand why we have to leave. Because, unh, it's not safe for us here anymore. Ron, tell your father supper's nearly ready. Is this in Australia? Looks wonderful, doesn't it? <i>Three and a half thousand kilometers along Australia's east coast.</i> <i>Obliviate.</i> Severus. I was beginning to worry you had lost your way. Come, we've saved you a seat. You bring news, I trust? It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall. I've heard differently, my Lord. Dawlish, the Auror, has let slip that the Potter boy... ...will not be moved until the 30th of this month. The day before he turns 17. This is a false trail. The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry. Well, they got that right, haven't they? What say you, Pius? One hears many things, my Lord. Whether the truth is among them is not clear. Heh. Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius. - Where will he be taken, the boy? - To a safe house. Most likely the home of someone in the Order. I'm told it's been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him. Ahem. My Lord. I'd like to volunteer myself for this task. I want to kill the boy. Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet? Yes, my Lord. Right away, my Lord. As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix... ...I must be the one to kill Harry Potter. But I face an unfortunate complication. That my wand and Potter's share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins. We can wound, but not fatally harm one another. If I am to kill him... ...I must do it with another's wand. Come, surely one of you would like the honor? Mm? What about you, Lucius? My Lord? ""My Lord?"" I require your wand. Do I detect elm? Yes, my Lord. And the core? Dragon. Ahem. Dragon heartstring, my Lord. - Dragon heartstring. - Mm. To those of you who do not know... ...we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage... ...who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her specialty was Muggle Studies. It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us. She would, given her way... ...have us mate with them. To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination... ...but something to be encouraged. Severus. Severus, please. We're friends. <i>Avada Kedavra!</i> Nagini. Dinner. - Hello, Harry. - All right. Wow. Hello. - You're looking fit. - Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous. What say we get undercover before someone murders him? Evening. I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister. You are more important. - Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley. - Oh. Pleasure to meet you. - He was never always this handsome. - Dead ugly. True enough. Owe it all to a werewolf, name of Greyback. - Hope to repay the favor one day. - You're still beautiful to me, William. Just remember, Fleur, Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now. My husband, the joker. By the way, wait till you hear the news. Remus and I-- All right. We'll have time for a cozy catch-up later. We've got to get the hell out of here. And soon. Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you. What's the Trace? If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose. We have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: Brooms, Thestrals and the like. We go in pairs. That way, if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be... ...they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one. The real one? I believe you're familiar with this particular brew. No. Absolutely not. I told you he'd take it well. No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone risk their lives for me, I-- - Never done that before, have we? - No. No. This is different. I mean, taking that, becoming me. No. Well, none of us really fancy it, mate. Imagine if something went wrong, and we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever. Everyone here is of age, Potter. They've all agreed to take the risk. Technically, I've been coerced. Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. - Always been a huge admirer. - Nip it, Mundungus. All right, Granger, as discussed. - Blimey, Hermione. - Straight in here, if you please. For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning: It tastes like goblin piss. Have a lot of experiences with that, do you, Mad-Eye? Just trying to diffuse the tension. Oh. Ugh. Wow, we're identical. Not yet, you're not. Haven't got anything a bit more sporting, have you? I don't really fancy this color. Well, fancy this, you're not you. So shut it and strip. All right, all right. You'll need to change too, Potter. Bill, look away. I'm hideous. I knew she was lying about that tattoo. Harry, your eyesight really is awful. Right, then. We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector. Mundungus, stick tight to me. I wanna keep an eye on you. - As for Harry-- - Yes? The real Harry. - Where the devil are you, anyway? - Here. You'll ride with Hagrid. I brought you here 16 years ago when you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only right that I should be the one to take you away now. Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go. Head for the Burrows. We'll rendezvous there. On the count of three. Hold tight, Harry. One... ...two... ...three! - Which one? - Where are you? He's on your right! He's over there! Down! Hagrid, we have to help the others! I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders. Hang on. <i>Stupefy!</i> Hang on, Harry. Hagrid. No. No. <i>Harry.</i> Harry. Hagrid. What happened? Where are the others? Is no one else back? They were on us right from the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance. Well, thank goodness you two are all right. The Death Eaters were waiting for us. It was an ambush. Ron and Tonks should've already been back. Dad and Fred as well. Here! Quick. Into the house. Oh, my boy. Oh. Oh. - Lupin! - What are you doing? What creature sat in the corner... ...the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts? - Are you mad? - What creature?! A Grindylow. We've been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren't an impostor. Wait. The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us? ""Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him."" What gave you away? Hedwig, I think. She was trying to protect me. Thanks. Deserves that. Brilliant, he was. - I wouldn't be standing here without him. - Really? Always the tone of surprise. We the last back? Where's George? How you feeling, Georgie? Saint-like. Come again? Saint-like. I'm holy. I'm holey, Fred. Get it? The whole wide world of ear-related humor and you go for ""I'm holey."" That's pathetic. Reckon I'm still better-looking than you. Mad-Eye's dead. Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated. <i>Head for the Burrows.</i> <i>This is beyond anything I imagined.</i> <i>- Seven? - Seven...? A Horcrux.</i> <i>They could be hidden anywhere.</i> <i>To rip the soul into seven pieces....</i> <i>- If you did destroy each Horcrux.... - One destroys Voldemort.</i> <i>Trust me.</i> <i>You lied to me. Lied to me, Ollivander.</i> Going somewhere? Nobody else is going to die. Not for me. For you? You think Mad-Eye died for you? You think George took that curse for you? You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that. It's always been bigger than that. - Come with me. - What, and leave Hermione? You mad? We wouldn't last two days without her. Don't tell her I said that. Besides, you've still got the Trace on you. - We've still got the wedding-- - I don't care about a wedding. I'm sorry. No matter whose it is. I have to start finding these Horcruxes. They're our only chance to beat him... ...and the longer we stay here, the stronger he gets. Tonight's not the night, mate. We'd only be doing him a favor. Do you think he knows? I mean, they're bits of his soul, these Horcruxes. Bits of him. When Dumbledore destroyed the ring, you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary... ...he must have felt something. To kill the other Horcruxes, we have to find them. Where are they? Where do we start? Ready when you are. Please pay attention! It's your brother's wedding. Buck up. Zip me up, will you? It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding? Given everything that's going on. Maybe that's the best reason to have it... ...because of everything that's going on. Morning. Come on, keep up. All together now. One, two, three. How's it looking at your end, boys? Brilliant. Bloody hell. What's the Minister of Magic doing here? To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister? I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter. And this is...? ""Herein is set forth the last will and testament... ...of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley... ...I leave my Deluminator... ...a device of my own making... ...in the hope that, when things seem most dark... ...it will show him the light."" - Dumbledore left this for me? - Yeah. Brilliant. What is it? Wicked. ""To Hermione Jean Granger... <i>...I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard...</i> ...in the hope that she find it entertaining and instructive."" Mom used to read me those. ""The Wizard and the Hopping Pot."" ""Babbitty Rabbitty and the Cackling Stump."" Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty. No? ""To Harry James Potter... ...I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts... ...as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance... ...and skill."" - Is that it, then? - Not quite. Dumbledore left you a second bequest: The sword of Godric Gryffindor. Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away. As an important historical artifact, it belongs-- To Harry. It belongs to Harry. It came to him when he needed it in the Chamber of Secrets. The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor. That does not make it that wizard's property. And, in any event, the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown. - Excuse me? - The sword is missing. I don't know what you're up to, Mr. Potter... ...but you can't fight this war on your own. He's too strong. Hello, Harry. I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I? I can see it growing smaller in your eyes. Of course not. How are you, Luna? Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago. Gnome saliva is very beneficial. Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill. Pleasure to meet you, sir. <i>I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler...</i> <i>...unlike those toadies at The Daily Prophet...</i> ...fully supported Dumbledore in his lifetime... ...and, in his death, support you just as fully. Thank you. Come, Daddy. Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now. He's just too polite to say so. Harry Potter. Excuse me, sir? May I sit down? Mr. Potter. By all means. Here. Thanks. <i>I found what you wrote in The Daily Prophet really moving.</i> You obviously knew Dumbledore well. Well, I certainly knew him the longest. That is, if you don't count his brother, Aberforth... ...and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth. - I didn't even know he had a brother. - Ah. Well, Dumbledore was always very private, even as a boy. Don't despair, Elphias. I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter... ...in 800 pages, no less. Word has it that someone talked to her. Someone who knew the Dumbledore family well. Both you and I know who that is, Elphias. A monstrous betrayal. Who are we talking about? Bathilda Bagshot. - Who? - My God, boy... ...she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century. She was as close to the Dumbledores as anyone. Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow... ...to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage. Godric's Hollow? Bathilda Bagshot lives at Godric's Hollow? Well, that's where she first met Dumbledore. You don't mean to say he lived there too? The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles. Oh, it was quite the scandal. Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all? <i>The Ministry has fallen.</i> <i>The Minister of Magic is dead.</i> <i>They are coming.</i> <i>They are coming.</i> <i>They are coming.</i> They're coming! Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter. - Ginny! - Harry! Go! Go! Here you go, sightseeing tour? Leaves in 15 minutes. - Where are we? - Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come to the theater here with Mom and Dad. I don't know why I thought of it. It just popped into my head. This way. We need to change. How the ruddy...? Undetectable Extension Charm. You're amazing, you are. Always the tone of surprise. Ah. That'll be the books. What about all the people at the wedding? - Do you think we should go back? - They were after you. We'd put everyone in danger by going back. - Ron's right. - Ahem. Coffee? - A cappuccino, please. - You? - What she said. - Same. So where do we go from here? Leaky Cauldron? It's too dangerous. If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe. Everyone from the wedding will have gone underground, into hiding. My rucksack with all my things, I've left it at the Burrow. You're joking. I've had all the essentials packed for days, just in case. By the way, these jeans, not my favorite. Down! <i>Stupefy!</i> <i>Expulso!</i> <i>Petrificus Totalus.</i> Go. Leave. Lock the door, get the lights. This one's name is Rowle. He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore. This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters. So, what we gonna do with you, hey? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you? If we kill them, they'll know we were here. Ron. Suppose he did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then? It's better we wipe their memories. You're the boss. Hermione... ...you're the best at spells. <i>Obliviate.</i> How is it they knew we were there? Maybe you still have the Trace on you? Can't be. Trace breaks at 17. It's wizarding law. What? We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I, we prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding. I appreciate the thought, but given the fact that we were almost killed... ...by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago.... Right. Perspective. We need to get off the streets, get somewhere safe. What was that all about? Probably Mad-Eye's idea, in case Snape decided to come snooping. <i>Homenum Revelio.</i> We're alone. <i>I believed another wand-</i> <i>You lied to me. It makes no sense.</i> I believed a different wand would work, I swear. There must be another way. Harry? Hermione, where are you? I think I've found something. Lovely. ""Regulus Arcturus Black."" R.A.B. ""I know I will be dead long before you read this. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it."" R.A.B. is Sirius's brother. Yes. Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux? You've been spying on us, have you? Kreacher has been watching. Maybe he knows where the real locket is. Have you ever seen this before? Kreacher? It's Master Regulus' locket. But there were two, weren't there? Where's the other one? Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is. Yes, but did you ever see it? Was it in this house? Filthy Mudblood. - Death Eaters are coming-- - Ron. - Blood traitor, Weasley. - Answer her. Yes. It was here in this house. A most evil object. How do you mean? Before Master Regulus died, he ordered Kreacher to destroy it... ...but no matter how hard Kreacher tried, he could not do it. Well, where is it now? - Did someone take it? - He came in the night. He took many things, including the locket. Who did? Who was it, Kreacher? Mundungus. Mundungus Fletcher. Find him. My father will hear about this. Hey, losers. He isn't here. As your new Minister for Magic... ...I promise to restore this temple of tolerance... ...to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today... ...each employee will submit themselves... ...for evaluation. You have nothing to fear... ...if you have nothing to hide. - How much? - Two Galleons. Come on, time is money. Cheers, pal. - Snatchers! - Move out of the way. - I told you. - Get out. Squash him. Be a bit gentler. They have flesh memories. When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch. That Dumbledore had hidden something inside it. <i>Many of you are wondering...</i> <i>...why Voldemort has yet to show himself now that he has vanquished...</i> <i>...the most powerful symbol of opposition to him and his followers.</i> Get off. Harry Potter, so long it's been. Get off me. As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief... <i>- Expellliarmus. - ... Mundungus Fletcher.</i> What you playing at? Setting a pair of bleeding house-elves after me. Dobby was only trying to help. Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious. And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name. - I just-- - And then Dobby saw Kreacher... - ...talking with the thief, Mundungus-- - I'm no thief. You foul little-- Git. I'm a purveyor of rare and wondrous objects. You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it. Master Weasley, so good to see you again. Wicked trainers. Listen, I panicked that night, all right? Could I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom? - You.... - Tell the truth. When you turned this place over-- Don't deny it. --you found a locket, am I right? Why? Was it valuable? You still got it? No, he's worried he didn't get enough money for it. Bleeding give it away, didn't I? There I was, flogging me wares in Diagon Alley... ...when some Ministry hag comes up and asks to see me license. Says she's a mind to lock me up. And would've done it too, if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket. - Who was she? The witch. Do you know? - No, I-- Well, she's there. Look. Bleeding bow and all. Right, remember what we said. Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary. Just try and act normal. Do what everybody else is doing. If we do that, then with a bit of luck, we'll get inside. - And then-- - It gets really tricky. - Correct. - Yeah. - This is completely mental. - Completely. The world's mental. Come on... ...we've got a Horcrux to find. We flush ourselves in. That's bloody disgusting. Name? You. Come. - What? What? - Come on. - What did I do? - Just keep walking. - Are those--? - Muggles. In their rightful place. Gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit. How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice would last, Hermione? I didn't. Cattermole. It's still raining inside my office. That's two days now. Have you tried an umbrella? You do realize I'm going downstairs, don't you, Cattermole? - Downstairs? - To interrogate your wife. Now, if my wife's blood status were in doubt... ...and the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement... ...needed a job doing, I think I might just make that a priority. You have one hour. Oh, my God. What am I gonna do? My wife's all alone downstairs. - Ron, you don't have a wife. - Oh, right. Level 2.</i> But how do I stop it raining? <i>Try ""Finite Incantatem.""</i> <i>Department of Magical Law Enforcement...</i> <i>...and Improper Use of Magic Department.</i> This is you, Ron. <i>Finite Incantatem. Okay. And if that doesn't work...?</i> <i>Level 1, Minister of Magic and support staff.</i> If we don't locate Umbridge within the hour... ...we go find Ron and come back another day. - Deal? - Yes. Ah, Mafalda. Travers sent you, did he? Good, we'll go straight down. Albert, aren't you getting out? Runcorn. <i>Accio locket.</i> All right, all right. Let's calm down, shall we? Let's get back to work, please. Calm down. Runcorn. Morning. Ron, it's me. Harry. Blimey, forgot what you looked like. Where's Hermione? She's gone down to the courtrooms, with Umbridge. Bloody cold down here. I'm a half-blood. My father was a wizard. William Alderton. He worked here for 30 years. Perhaps you know him. Always wore his jacket inside out. No, there's been a mistake. I'm half-blood, you see. We must go back. I'm half-blood. - Mary Elizabeth Cattermole? - Yes. Of 27 Chislehurst Gardens, Great Tolling, Evesham? - Yes. - It's here. Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred? Wife to Reginald? Reg? Thank you, Albert. Mary Elizabeth Cattermole? Yes. A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today. Is this that wand? Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand? I didn't take it. I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's, when I was 11. It chose me. You're lying. Wands only choose witches, and you are not a witch. But I am. Tell them, Reg. Tell them what I am. Reg, tell them what I am. What on earth are you doing, Albert? You're lying, Dolores. And one mustn't tell lies. <i>Stupefy!</i> It's Harry Potter. It is, isn't it? This'll be one to tell the kids. <i>Expecto Patronum!</i> Oh. Oh. Oh. Mary, go home. Get the kids. I'll meet you there. We have to get out of the country, understand? Mary, do as I say. Mary? Who's that? Long story. Nice meeting you. It's Harry Potter. It's Harry. Harry Potter. - There he is. - Get him! - Get him! - Stop him! - Watch out. - Look out. This way! <i>Expellliarmus!</i> Oh, my God. Shh, shh, shh. It's all right. It's okay. Harry. Harry, quickly, in my bag. There's a bottle labeled ""Essence of Dittany."" Shh. Shh. Okay, okay. Quickly. <i>- Accio Dittany. Shh.</i> It's all right. Unstopper it. Hermione, his arm. I know, just do it. It's okay. - Okay, it's gonna sting a little bit. - What happened? I thought we meant... - ...to be going back to Grimmauld Place. - We were. We were. Shh. It's all right. One more, one more. We were there, we were there, but Yaxley had hold of me, and I.... I knew once he'd seen where we were, we couldn't stay... ...so I brought us here... ...but Ron got splinched. It's all right. <i>Protego Totalum.</i> <i>Salvio Hexia.</i> What are you doing? Protective enchantments. I don't fancy another visit like the one we had in Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? You can get going on the tent. <i>- Tent? Protego Totalum.</i> Where am I supposed to find a tent? <i>Repello Muggletum. Muffliato.</i> You first. <i>Dissendium.</i> <i>Incendio.</i> <i>Expulso.</i> <i>Diffindo.</i> <i>Reducto.</i> What are you doing? We have to keep it safe until we find out how to destroy it. Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off... ...to find all these Horcruxes, but doesn't tell you how to destroy them. Doesn't that bother you? <i>A goblin by the name of Gornuk was killed.</i> <i>It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin...</i> <i>...both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell...</i> <i>...and Gornuk, may have escaped.</i> <i>If Dean is listening or anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts...</i> <i>...his parents and sisters are desperate for news.</i> <i>Meanwhile, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home.</i> <i>You know the spell, Harry.</i> <i>Tell me.</i> <i>Tell me, Gregorovitch.</i> It was stolen from me. Who was he? The thief? <i>It was a boy. It was he who took it.</i> <i>I never saw it again.</i> I swear on my life. I believe you. <i>Avada Kedavra!</i> I thought it had stopped. You can't keep letting him in, Harry. You-Know-Who has found Gregorovitch. The wandmaker? He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have... ...but I don't know what. But he wants it desperately. I mean, it's as if his life depends on it. Don't. - It comforts him. - It sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear, good news? <i>- who long expected it, the fall of the Ministry was shocking.</i> I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news. <i>We promise to remain your eyes and ears-</i> How long before he can travel? <i>- bringing you news when we can, from wherever we can.</i> I'm doing everything I can. You're not doing enough! Take it off. I said, take it off now. - Better? - Loads. We'll take it in turns, okay? <i>Finch does admit his invention currently has one short.</i> <i>And now, other news:</i> <i>Severus Snape, newly-appointed headmaster of Hogwarts...</i> <i>...has decreed that all students must conform to the latest house rules.</i> <i>Hogwarts bears little resemblance to the school under Dumbledore's leadership.</i> <i>Snape's curriculum is severe, reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...</i> <i>...and infractions are dealt with harshly by the two Death Eaters on staff.</i> What's that? What's that smell? - What you doing? - It's heavy. Oh, sorry. Do you want me to carry it? - Yeah, thank you. - Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up. Numpty. Snatchers. Good to know your enchantments work. He could smell it. My perfume. I've told you... ...Ron isn't strong enough to Apparate. Well, then, we'll go on foot. And next time, Hermione, as much as I like your perfume, just don't wear any. <i>And now for the names of missing witches and wizards.</i> <i>These are confirmed.</i> <i>Thankfully, the list is short today.</i> <i>Jason and Alison Denbright.</i> Oh. Thank you. <i>Bella, Jake, Charlie, and Madge Farley.</i> <i>Joe Laurie.</i> <i>Eleanor Sarah Gibbs.</i> <i>Harry and Bronwyn Trigg.</i> <i>Rob and Ellie Dowson.</i> <i>Georgia Clark-Day.</i> <i>Joshua Flexson.</i> <i>George Coutas.</i> <i>Gabriella and Emily Mather.</i> <i>Jacob and Mimi Erland.</i> <i>William and Brian Gallagher.</i> He doesn't know what he's doing, does he? None of us do. <i>Toby and Olivia Gleaves.</i> <i>Katie and James Killick.</i> <i>Elsie Valentine Schroeder.</i> <i>Jennifer Winston.</i> <i>Tamsin and lola Hillicker.</i> <i>Scarlet and Kitty Sharp.</i> Oh, my God. What? I'll tell you in a minute. Maybe you could tell me now. The sword of Gryffindor, it's goblin-made. Brilliant. No, you don't understand. Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger. Okay. Harry, you've already destroyed one Horcrux, right? Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets. With a Basilisk fang. If you tell me you've got one of those... - ...in that bloody beaded bag of yours.... - Don't you see? In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor. Its blade is impregnated with Basilisk venom. It only takes in that which makes it stronger. - Exactly, which is why-- - It can destroy Horcruxes. That's why Dumbledore left it to you in his will. You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly. Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past extraneous detail... ...and perceive clearly that which others overlook. Yeah, there's only one problem, of course. The sword was stolen. Yeah, I'm still here. But you two carry on. Don't let me spoil the fun. - What's wrong? - Wrong? Nothing's wrong. Not according to you, anyway. Look, if you've got something to say, don't be shy. Spit it out. All right, I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful... ...because there's another damn thing we've gotta find. I thought you knew what you signed up for. Yeah. I thought I did too. Well then, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand. What part of this isn't living up to your expectations? Did you think we were gonna be staying in a hotel? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Thought you'd be back by Christmas? I just thought, after all this time... ...we would've achieved something. I thought you knew what you were doing. I thought Dumbledore told you something worthwhile. - I thought you had a plan. - I told you everything Dumbledore told me. In case you haven't noticed, we found a Horcrux. Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them. Ron. Please, take-- Take the Horcrux off. You wouldn't be saying this... ...if you hadn't been wearing it all day. Want to know why I listen to that radio? To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name, or Fred, or George or Mom. You think I'm not listening? You think I don't know how this feels?! No, you don't know how it feels! Your parents are dead. You have no family. - Stop. Stop. - Fine, then go! Go, then! Fine. Ron. And you? Are you coming or you staying? Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night. Ron, that's-- That's nothing. Ron-- Ron, where are you going? Please, come back. Ron. Ron! <i>Salvio Hexia.</i> <i>Repellum Muggletum.</i> <i>Salvio Hexia.</i> <i>Poor old Jim's white as a ghost</i> <i>He's found the answer that we lost</i> <i>We're all weeping now Weeping because</i> <i>There ain't nothing we can do To protect you</i> <i>O children</i> <i>Lift up your voice</i> <i>Lift up your voice</i> <i>Children</i> <i>Rejoice, rejoice</i> <i>Hey, little train, we're jumping on</i> <i>The train that goes to the kingdom</i> <i>We're happy, Ma We're having fun</i> <i>And the train ain't even left the station</i> <i>Hey, little train, wait for me</i> <i>I once was blind but now I see</i> <i>Have you left a seat for me? <i>Is that such a stretch of the imagination?</i> <i>Hey, little train, wait for me</i> <i>I was held in chains but now I'm free</i> <i>I'm hanging in there Don't you see?</i> <i>In this process of elimination</i> <i>Hey, little train, we're jumping on</i> <i>The train that goes to the kingdom</i> <i>We're happy, Ma We're having fun</i> <i>It's beyond my wildest expectation</i> <i>Hey, little train, we're jumping on</i> <i>The train that goes to the kingdom</i> <i>We're happy, Ma We're having fun</i> <i>The train ain't even left the station</i> Hermione. Hermione? You were right. Snitches have flesh memories... ...but I didn't catch the first Snitch with my hand, I almost swallowed it. - ""I open at the close."" - What do you think that means? I don't know. I found something as well. At first I thought it was an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere in Spellman's Syllabary. Somebody inked it in. It isn't part of the book. Somebody drew it. Luna's dad was wearing that at Bill and Fleur's wedding. Why would someone draw it in a children's book? Look, Hermione, I've been thinking. I want to go to Godric's Hollow. It's where I was born. It's where my parents died. That's exactly where he'll expect you to go because it means something to you. Yeah, but it means something to him too, Hermione. You-Know-Who almost died there. I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux? It's dangerous, Harry. But even I have to admit, recently I've been thinking we'll have to go there. I think it's possible something else is hidden there. What? The sword. If Dumbledore wanted you to find it, but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands... ...where better to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor? Hermione.... Don't ever let me give you a haircut again. I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion. No. This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else. Good night. Ha-ha-ha. Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve. Listen. Do you think they'd be in there, Hermione? My mom and dad. Yeah, I think they would. ""Ignotus Peverell."" Hey, Harry? Merry Christmas, Hermione. Merry Christmas, Harry. Harry, there's someone watching us. By the church. I think I know who that is. I don't like this, Harry. Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them. You're Bathilda, aren't you? Here, let me do that. Miss Bagshot, who is this man? Harry. <i>Lumos.</i> Harry! <i>Confringo!</i> Are you feeling better? You've outdone yourself this time, Hermione. The Forest of Dean. I came here once with Mom and Dad, years ago. It's just how I remember it. The trees, the river, everything. Like nothing's changed. Not true, of course. Everything's changed. If I brought my parents back here now, they probably wouldn't recognize any of it. Not the trees, not the river... ...not even me. Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old. You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was. I know. Gellert Grindelwald. He's the thief I saw in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop. Speaking of which, where is my wand? Where's my wand, Hermione? As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded. I'm sorry. - I tried to mend it, but wands are different. - It's done. Leave me yours. Go inside and get warm. I'll take the locket as well. <i>Trust me.</i> <i>Lumos.</i> <i>Accio sword.</i> <i>Diffindo.</i> - Hermione? - Are you mental? It was you? Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think. And you cast the doe as well, did you? - No, I thought that was you. - No, my Patronus is a stag. Right. Yeah. Antlers. Okay, Ron. Do it. I can't handle it. That thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione. - All the more reason. - No. I can't. Then why are you here? Why did you come back? Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don't hesitate. I don't know what's in there, but it'll put up a fight. The bit of Riddle that was in that diary tried to kill me. All right. One... ...two... ...three. <i>I have seen your heart, and it is mine.</i> <i>I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley...</i> <i>...and I have seen your fears.</i> <i>Least loved by your mother, who craved a daughter.</i> <i>Least loved by the girl who prefers your friend.</i> Ron, kill it! We were better without you. Happier without you. Who could look at you compared to Harry Potter? What are you compared with the Chosen One? Ron, it's lying! Your mother confessed she would have preferred me as a son. What woman would take you? You are nothing. Nothing. Nothing compared to him. Just think... ...only three to go. Hermione? Hermione? Is everything all right? It's fine. Actually, you know, it's more than fine. Hey. You complete ass, Ronald Weasley! You show up here after weeks, and you say ""hey""? - Where's my wand? Where's my wand? - I don't know. - Harry Potter, give me my wand. - I don't have it. - How come he's got your wand? - Never mind why he's got my wand. What is that? You destroyed it. And how is it that you just happen to have the sword of Gryffindor? It's a long story. - Don't think this changes anything. - Oh, of course not. I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux. Why would that change anything? Look, I wanted to come back as soon as I left. - I just didn't know how to find you. - Yeah, how did you find us? With this. It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning I was sleeping in this little pub... ...keeping away from some Snatchers... ...and I heard it. It? A voice... ...your voice, Hermione... ...coming out of it. - And what exactly did I say, may I ask? - My name. Just my name. Like a whisper. So I took it, clicked it, and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew. And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light... ...went right to my chest, straight through me. Right here. And I knew it was gonna take me where I needed to go, so I Disapparated... ...and came to this hillside. It was dark. I had no idea where I was. I just hoped that one of you would show yourself. And you did. I've always liked these flames Hermione makes. How long do you reckon she'll stay mad at me? Well, just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart... ...and she'll come round. It was true. Every word. This is gonna sound crazy... ...but I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator. I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way back, and she'd lead me. Bloody hell, I just realized, you need a wand, don't you? - Yeah. - I've got one here. It's a blackthorn. Ten inches. Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do. Took if off a Snatcher a couple of weeks ago. Don't tell Hermione this, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers. This one was definitely part troll, the smell of him. <i>Engorgio.</i> <i>- Reducio! What's going on in there?</i> - Nothing. - Nothing. We need to talk. Yeah, all right. - I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood. - Sorry? See this? It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature. It's the mark again. It keeps cropping up. <i>In Beedle the Bard, in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.</i> It was there too. - Where? - Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop. But what does it mean? Look, you've got no idea where the next Horcrux is, and neither do I... ...but this, this means something. - I'm sure of it. - Yeah. Hermione's right. We ought to see Lovegood. Let's vote on it. Those in favor? You're not still mad at him, are you? I'm always mad at him. Luna. Luna. ""Keep off the dirigible plums."" What is it? Who are you? What do you want? Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter. We met a few months ago. Could we come in? - Where is Luna? - Luna? She'll be along. So how can I help you, Mr. Potter? Well, actually.... It was about something you were wearing round your neck at the wedding. A symbol. You mean this? Yes. That exactly. What we've wondered is, what is it? What is it? Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course. - The what? - The what? The Deathly Hallows. I assume you're all familiar with ""The Tale of the Three Brothers."" - Yes. - No. I have it in here. ""There were once three brothers... ...who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight."" Midnight. Mom always said ""midnight."" But ""twilight's"" fine. Better, actually. Do you want to read it? No. It's fine. <i>""There were once three brothers...</i> <i>...who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.</i> <i>In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass.</i> But being learned in the magical arts...</i> <i>...the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge.</i> Before they could cross, however...</i> <i>...they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.</i> <i>It was Death, and he felt cheated.</i> <i>Cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river.</i> <i>But Death was cunning.</i> <i>He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic...</i> <i>...and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.</i> <i>The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence.</i> <i>So Death fashioned him one from an elder tree that stood nearby.</i> <i>The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further...</i> <i>...and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave.</i> <i>So Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him.</i> <i>Finally, Death turned to the third brother.</i> <i>A humble man...</i> <i>...he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place...</i> <i>...without being followed by Death.</i> <i>And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.</i> <i>The first brother traveled to a distant village...</i> <i>...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...</i> <i>...he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled.</i> <i>Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him...</i> <i>...he bragged of his invincibility.</i> <i>But that night, another wizard stole the wand...</i> <i>...and slit the brother's throat for good measure.</i> And so Death took the first brother for his own.</i> <i>The second brother journeyed to his home...</i> <i>...where he took the stone and turned it thrice in hand.</i> <i>To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped to marry before her untimely death...</i> <i>...appeared before him.</i> <i>Yet, soon she turned sad and cold for she did not belong in the mortal world.</i> <i>Driven mad with hopeless longing...</i> <i>...the second brother killed himself so as to join her.</i> <i>And so Death took the second brother.</i> <i>As for the third brother...</i> <i>...Death searched for many years but was never able to find him.</i> <i>Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother...</i> <i>...shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son.</i> <i>He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly...</i> <i>...departing this life as equals.""</i> So there you are. Those are the Deathly Hallows. I'm sorry, sir. I still don't quite understand. Where's that pen I had? The Elder Wand. The most powerful wand ever made. The Resurrection Stone. The Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one master of Death. That mark was on a grave in Godric's Hollow. Uh, Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell Family... ...have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows? Uh-- Uh-- Ignotus-- Excuse me. --and his brothers, Cadmus and Antioch... ...are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows... ...and therefore the inspiration for the story. Uh-- Uh-- But your tea's gone cold. I'll be right back. Let's go down here. Let's get out of here. I'm not drinking any more of that stuff, hot or cold. Thank you, sir. - You forgot the water. - Water? For the tea. Did--? Did I? How silly of me. It's no matter. We really should be going anyway. No, you can't! Sir? You're my only hope. They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing. So they took her. They took my Luna. My Luna. But it's really you they want. Who took her, sir? Voldemort. Stop! I've got him! That treacherous little bleeder. Is there no one we can trust? They kidnapped her because he supported me. He was just desperate. I'll do the enchantments. Hello, beautiful. Well, don't hang about, snatch them. <i>Harry.</i> <i>Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.</i> <i>Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.</i> Hello, Tom. I knew you would come one day... ...but surely you must know I no longer have what you seek. - Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is. - Ha-ha-ha. Tell me who possesses it. The Elder Wand lies with him, of course... ...buried in the earth. Dumbledore. The Hallows exist... ...but he's only after one of them, the last one. He knows where it is. He's gonna have it by the end of the night. You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand. - Don't touch her. Unh! - Leave him. Your boyfriend will get worse than that... Get off me. ...if he doesn't learn to behave himself. What happened to you, ugly? No, not you. - What's your name? - Dudley. Vernon Dudley. Check it. And you, my lovely... ...what do they call you? Penelope Clearwater, half-blood. There's no Vernon Dudley on here. Did you hear that, ugly? The list says you're lying. How come you don't want us to know who you are? The list's wrong. I told you who I am. Change of plan. We're not taking this lot to the Ministry. Get Draco. Well? - I can't be sure. - Draco. Look closely, son. If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord... ...everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand? Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy. You dare to talk to me like that in my own house? Lucius. Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over. Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure. What's wrong with his face? Yes, what is wrong with his face? He came to us like that. Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon. Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We'll see what her last spell was. Ah. Got you. What is that? Where'd you get that from? It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it's mine now. Are you mad? Go! Get out! Cissy, put the boys in the cellar. I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl. What are we gonna do? We can't leave Hermione alone with her. Ron? Harry? Luna? That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it? What else did you and your friends take from my vault?! I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything. I don't believe it. We have to do something. There's no way out of here. We've tried everything. It's enchanted. - Please! please! - Shut up! You're bleeding, Harry. That's a curious thing to keep in your sock. Help us. - Let her go. - Shut up. Get back. You, goblin, come with me. - Aah! - Dobby? What are you doing here? Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course. Dobby will always be there for Harry Potter. You can Apparate in and out of this room? Could you take us with you? Of course, sir. I'm an elf. Works for me. Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander-- Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. Trust me. Whenever you're ready, sir. Sir? I like her very much. Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds. Ow. Who gets his wand? I'm only going to ask you once more, goblin. Think very, very carefully before you answer. I don't know. You don't know? Why weren't you doing your job? Who got into my vault? Who stole it? Who stole it? Well? When I was last in your vault, the sword was there. Oh, well then, perhaps it just walked out on its own then. There is no place safer than Gringotts. Liar! Consider yourself lucky, goblin. The same won't be said for this one. Like hell. <i>Expellliarmus!</i> <i>Stupefy.</i> Stop! Drop your wands. I said, drop them! Pick them up, Draco, now. Well, well, well, look what we have here. It's Harry Potter. He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord. Call him. Call him. <i>Stupefy!</i> Stupid elf. - You could've killed me. - Dobby never meant to kill. Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure. How dare you take a witch's wand? How dare you defy your masters? Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf. And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends. Hermione. You're all right. We're safe. We're all safe. Harry Potter. Dobby. Dobby. No, just-- Hold on. Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay? We'll fix you. Hermione will have something. In your bag. Hermione? Hermione? What is it? Help me. Such a beautiful place... ...to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend... ...Harry Potter. We should close his eyes. Don't you think? There. Now he could be sleeping. I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic.

8 Harry,"It's beautiful here. It was our aunt�s. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house. What's left of us at least. Muggles think these things keep evil away. But they're wrong. I need to talk to the Goblin. How are you? Alive. You probably don't remember that you-- --That I showed you to your vault, the first time you came to Gringotts. Even amongst Goblins, you are famous Harry Potter. - You buried the elf? - Yes. And brought me here. You are... Pretty unusual, is it? How did you come by the sword? It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts? It's complicated. The sword presented itself to us, in moment of need. We didn't steal it. There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one. But it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer. And she never suspected it was a fake. The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor. Who is the acquaintance? A Hogwarts Professor. As I understand that he's now Headmaster. Snape. He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault. Why? There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts. And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well? Perhaps. I need to get into Gringotts. Into one of the vaults. - It is impossible. - Alone, yes. But with you, no. - Why should I help you? - I have gold. Lots of it. I've no interest in gold. Then what? That. That is my price. Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault? Well, she was terrified when she thought we had been in there. She kept asking you, what else was taken? I bet you anything, there's Horcrux in there. Another piece of his soul. Let's find it, kill it, and we are one step closer to killing him. And what happens when we find it, How're we supposed to destroy it, now you're giving the sword to Griphook? I'm still working on that part. He's weak. Who? Mr. Ollivander I need to ask you a few questions. Anything, m'boy. Anything! Would you mind identifying this wand? We need to know if it's safe to use. Uhh... Walnut Dragon Heartstring 12 and three quarter inches. Unyie... Unyielding. This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange. And this? Hawthorn. An unicorn hair. 10 inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy. Was? Is it not still? Well, perhaps not. If you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed. You talk about wands, as if they have feelings... .......can think! The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who've studied wandlore. And, what do you know about the Deathly Hallows? It is rumored there are three. The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility, to hide you from your enemies... and the Resurrection Stone, to bring back loved ones from the dead. Together, they make one the Master of Death. But few, truly believe that such objects exist. Do you? Do you believe they exist, sir? Well... I see no reason to put stock into an old wives' tale. You're lying! You know one exists. You told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand... and where he could go looking for it. He tortured me. Besides... ....I only conveyed rumors. There's... There's no telling whether he will find it. He has found it, sir. We'll let you rest. He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid, ...you really don't stand a chance. Well, I suppose I'll have to kill him, before he finds me, then. You're sure that's hers? Positive. Well? How do I look? Hideous. You can give that to Hermione to hold. Alright, Griphook? We're relying on you, Griphook. If you get us past the guards into the vault... The sword's yours. Madam Lestrange. Good morning. Good morning? Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some school girl! Hey! Easy! If she gives us away, we must swear to use that sword to slit our own throats. Understand? No, he's right. I speak stupid. Okay. Let's do it. I wish to enter my vault. Identification? I hardly think that would be necessary. Madam Lestrange. I don't like to be kept waiting. <i>I know...</i> <i>They know she's an impostor.</i> <i>They'd be warned.</i> Harry... What do we do, Harry? Madam Lestrange, would you mind presenting your wand? And why should I do that? It's the bank's policy! I'm sure you understand, given current climate. No! I most certainly do not understand! I'm afraid, I must insist. <i>Imperio!</i> Very well, Madam Lestrange. If you will follow me? What is that, Griphook? Griphook! <i>Aresto Momentum</i> Well done, Hermione. Oh no, you two're like you again. The Thief's Downfall, washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly. You don't say. Just out of interest, is there any other way out of here? No. What the devil are all you doing down here? Thieves! You gave up the..... <i>-Imperio -You!</i> That doesn't sound good. Bloody hell! That's an Ukrainian Ironbelly. Here. It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise. That's barbaric! <i>Lumos</i> Blimey! <i>Accio Horcrux</i> You seem you're gonna try that one to get over here? No kind of magic would work in here. It's in here, Harry? Can you feel anything? That's it! Up there! They have added the Gemino curse. Everything you touch will multiply. Give me the sword. Stop moving! Do it! - We had deal, Griphook! - The cup for the sword! I said I'll get you in, I didn't say anything about getting you out. Griphook! Thieves! Griphook! Hey, thieves! Is that okay? We've still got Bogrod. That's unfortunate. We can't just stand here, You got any idea? You're the brilliant one. I've got something, but it's mad! <i>Reducto</i> Well, come on, then! <i>Relashio</i> Keep moving! Now what? <i>Reducto</i> Hold on. That was brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! We're dropping! - I say we jump! - When? Now! He knows. You-Know-Who. He knows we broke into Gringotts. He knows what we took, and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes. - How is it you know? - I saw him. You let him in? Harry, you can't do that! Hermione, I can't always help it! Well, maybe I can. I don't know! Never mind! What happened? Well, he's angry... and scared too. He knows, if we find and destroy all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him. I reckon he'll stop at nothing to make sure we don't find the rest. And there's more. One of them is at Hogwarts. What? You saw it? I saw the castle. And Rowena Ravenclaw. It must have something to do with her. We have to go there, now! Well, we can't do that! We've got to plan, we've got to figure it out! Hermione, when have any of our plans ever actually worked? We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose. He's right! One problem... Snape's Headmaster now, we can't just move from the front door! Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade, to Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar. It's... There's something wrong with him. It's like, you know, in the past... I've always been able to follow his thoughts. And now everything just feels disconnected. Maybe it's the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying! No! No, it's.. it's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous. - Right here. Come on! - Search everywhere. Go, move! Faster! In here, Potter. <i>Come on, move!</i> Did you look at him? - For a second I thought that was... - I know. Dumbledore! Harry? I can see you in this. Bloody fools, what were you thinking, coming here? Have you any idea how dangerous it is? You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother. It's you who I've been seeing in here. You're the one who sent Dobby. - Why've you left him? - He's dead. Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf. Who gave that to you? The mirror? Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago. Dung had no right selling that to you. It belongs to... Sirius... Albus told me. He also told me you'd likely be hacked off, ...if you ever found that I had it. But, ask yourself; Where would you be if I didn't? Do you have any others much? From the Order? The Order's finished. You-Know-Who's won, ...anyone who says otherwise is killing themselves. We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight. Dumbledore gave us a job to do. Did he now... Nice job? Easy? We've been hunting Horcruxes. And we think the last one's inside the castle. But we'll need your help getting in. Which job my brother has given you no, it's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor, boy. Go home! Live a little longer. Dumbledore trusted me to see this through. What makes you think you can trust him? What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you? And in all the time you knew him... Did he ever mention my name? Did he ever mentioned hers? - Why should he... - Keep secrets. You tell me? - I trusted him. - That's a boy's answer. A boy goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who wouldn't even tell him where to start. You're lying! Not just on me, that doesn't matter. To yourself as well. That's what a fool does. You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter! So, I'll ask you again, there must be a reason. I'm not interested in what happened between you and your brother. I don't care that you've given up. I trusted the man I knew. We need to get into the castle tonight. You know what to do. Where've you sent her? You'll see. Soon enough. That's your sister, Ariana. Isn't it? She died very young, didn't she? My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter. On his journey to find power. Including Ariana. And she was devoted to him. He gave her everything, ...but time. Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore. He did save our lives twice! Kept an eye on us on that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up! She's coming back. What's that with her? Neville! - How you look... - Like hell, I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. Hey, Ab! We've got a couple more coming through. Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map. That's because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off, before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out, now. The grounds are crawled with Death Eaters and Dementors. How about Mr.Snape as Headmaster? Hardly ever seen. It's the Carrows who's watch out for. Carrows? Yeah. Brother and sister. Incharge of discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows. They did that to you? Why? Today's Dark Arts lesson was practicing the Cruciatus curse. On first years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed. Let's have a bit of fun, shall we? Hey, listen up you lot! I've for you a surprise. No more Aberforth's cook gonna help. We'll be surprised if we can digest that. - Oh my! - Harry! Get the word out to Remus and the others, that Harry is back. Okay, okay! Let's not kill him before You-Know-Who does. ...Do you read? We've a new weather report. Lightning has struck. I repeat: Lightning has struck. What's the fun, Harry? Okay. There's something we need to find. Something hidden here, in the castle. And it may help us to defeat You-Know-Who. - Alright, what is it? - We don't know. - Where is it? - We don't know that either. I realize there's not much to go on. That's nothing to go on. I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw. It'll be small, easily concealed. Anyone, any ideas? Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem. Oh, bloody hell! Here we go! Lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn't anyone heard of this? It's quite famous. Yes. But, Luna, it's lost. For centuries. There's no person alive today who's seen it. Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is? It's a sort of crown. You know, like a tiara. Harry! Hi, there. Six months she doesn't see me and it's like I'm a frankie first-year. I'm her brother! - She's got lots of them, but she's got only one Harry. - Shut up, Seamus! What is it, Ginny? Snape knows... he knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade. Many of you are surely wondering, why I have summoned you at this hour. It's come to my attention, that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade. Now... should anyone... student or staff attempt to aid Mr. Potter? They will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transcription, further more... Any person found to have knowledge of these events... who fails to come forward... ...will be treated as equally guilty. Another... If anyone in here has any knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening. I invite them to step forward. Now! It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, ...you still have a bit of security problem, Headmaster. I'm afraid it's quite extensive. How dare you stand where he stood? Tell them how it happened that night? Tell them how you looked him in the eye... A man who trusted you, and killed him. Tell them! COWARD!!! <i>Harry.</i> Potter? <i>I know that many of you will want to fight.</i> <i>Some of you may even think that to fight is wise.</i> <i>But this is folly.</i> <i>Give me Harry Potter.</i> <i>Do this and none shall be harmed.</i> <i>Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.</i> <i>Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.</i> <i>You have one hour.</i> What're you waiting for? Someone grab him! Students out of bed! Students out of bed! Students in the corridor! They're supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot! Sorry ma'am. As it happens, Mr. Filch... Your arrival is most opportune. If you would, I would like you please, to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall. Exactly where is it I'll be leading 'em to, ma'am? The dungeons would do. I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. What is it you need? Time, Professor. As much as you can get me. Do what you have to do. I'll secure the castle. Potter... It's good to see you. It's good to see you too, Professor. Hold the fort, Neville. Harry! Hermione and I've been thinking, it doesn't matter if we find a Horcrux. What do you mean? Unless we can destroy it. So, we were thinking... Well, Ron was thinking, it was Ron's idea. It's completely brilliant. You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary with a Basilisk's fang, right? Well, me and Hermione did remind where we might find one. Okay. Okay, but take this. That way, you can find me when you get back. Where're you going? Ravenclaw common room, Gotta start somewhere. Harry! Harry! Let me get this straight, Professor... You're actually giving us permission to do this? That is correct, Longbottom. To blow it up! Boom! Boom! Wicked! But how on earth are we gonna do that? Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan? As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyro-technics. I can bring it down. That's the spirit! Away, you go. You do realize, of course, we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely. That doesn't mean we can't delay him. And his name is Voldemort. Filius, you might as well use it. He's come to try to kill you, either way! <i>Piertotum Locomotor.</i> Hogwarts is threatened. Man the boundaries! Protect us. Do your duty... ....to our school. I've always wanted to use that spell! <i>Protego Maxima</i> <i>Fianto Duri</i> <i>Repello Inimigotum</i> <i>Protego Maxima</i> <i>Fianto Duri</i> <i>Repello....</i> <i>Protego Maxima</i> <i>Fianto Duri</i> <i>Repello Inimigotum</i> <i>Protego Maxima</i> Harry, wait! I need to talk to you! - I'm a bit pre-occupied at the moment, Luna. - You don't know anything where you're going. You're wasting your time! Look, we'll talk later, okay, Luna? - Harry? - Later. Harry Potter, you listen to me right now! Do you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem? There is not a person alive who's seen it. It's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead. It's very impressive, isn't it? If you've to find her, you'll find her down there. - Aren't you coming? - No. I think it's best if you two talk alone. She's very shy. You're the Grey Lady. The ghost of Ravenclaw tower. I do not answer to that name! No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw, Rowena's daughter. Are you a friend of Luna's? Yes. And she thought you might be able to help me. You seek my mother's diadem? Yes. That's right. Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others. But she was wrong, I cannot help you! Wait, please! I want to destroy it! They never learn. Such a pity. But, my Lord... Shouldn't we wait? My Lord! Begin! I thought you want to do it. Isn't it, Helena? You want to destroy it? Another swore to destroy it, many years ago. A strange boy with a strange name. Tom Riddle. But he lied. He's lied to many people. I know what he's done! I know who he is! He defiled it, with dark magic! I can destroy it. Once and for all. But only if you tell me where he hid it? You do know, where he hid it? Don't you, Helena? You just have to tell me. Please! Strange! You remind me of him a bit. It's here, in the castle. In the place where everything is hidden. If you have to ask... ....you will never know. If you know... ...you need only ask. Thank you! Tell Professor McGonagall. Remus and I will handle this side of the castle. Yes, sir! Hey Dean, on second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall we might need one or two more wands this side. It is the quality of one's convictions that determine his success.. ...not the number of followers. Who said that? Me. You okay, Freddie? Yeah. Me too. Harry talks in his sleep. Do you know this? No, of course, not! Yeah? You and whose army? You do it. I can't. Yes, you can! Neville! That went well. Get inside! This way! Take cover! Take cover <i>Stupefy</i> Ginny, Neville! You alright? Never better! I feel like I can spit fire! Have you seen Luna up here? Luna? I'm mad for her. I think it�s about time I told her since we�ll probably both be dead by dawn. I know. Bloody hell! We'll never find him on this. Here he is! - Just now... - Brilliant! He just vanished. I just now I saw it. Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement. It doesn't show up on the map, does it? You said that last year. That's right, I....I did. Let's go. Brilliant! Come on! Well, well... What brings you here, Potter? I could ask you the same. You have something of mine. I'd like it back. What's wrong with the one you have? It's my mother's. It's powerful, but it's... ..not the same. Doesn't quite understand me. You know what I mean? Why didn't you tell her? Bellatrix? You knew it was me. You didn't say anything. Come on, Draco! Don't be a prat. Do it! Easy! <i>Expelliarmus</i> <i>Avada Kedavra</i> <i>Stupefy</i> This is my girlfriend, you bloody gits! Got it! They've set the bloody place on fire! Come on! This way! We can't leave them! He's joking, right? If we die for them, Harry, I'm gonna kill you! Harry! My Lord? Avada Kedavra! Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe. It's the snake.... ....and she's the last one. It's the last Horcrux. Look inside him, Harry. Find out where he is, if you find him, we can find the snake. And we can end this! My Lord... Might it be less... I should not be more prudent to call off this attack. Simply seek the boy. Yourself. I do not need to seek the boy... ....before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand? Look at me! How can you live with yourself, Lucius? I don't know. Go and find Severus. Bring him to me. I know where he is. Come on! No! You have performed extra-ordinary magic with this wand, My Lord, ...in the last few hours alone. No! No! I am extra-ordinary. But the wand resists me. There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself has said it. Tonight, when the boy comes. It will not fail you, I am sure of it... It answers to you, and you only. Does it? My Lord? The wand, does it truly answer to me? You're a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know... - Where does its true loyalty lie? - With you... Of course, My Lord. The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine. You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus. But only I can live forever. My Lord... Nagini, kill! Take it... Take it up, please! Give me something! Quickly, a flask. Anything! Take them to the Pensieve. Look at me... You really have your mother's eyes. <i>You've fought valiantly, but in vain...</i> <i>I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste.</i> <i>I, therefore command my forces to retreat...</i> <i>In their absence, dispose your dead with dignity,</i> <i>Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.</i> <i>On this night, you have allowed your friends to die for you, rather than face me yourself.</i> <i>There is no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...</i> <i>...and confront your fate.</i> <i>If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.</i> Where's everybody? Harry? Oh, come on! Don't be sad on it, she's passed. There, she's gone. <i>Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy! You're freak!</i> <i>You're freak, Lily!</i> <i>Come here!</i> <i>She's jealous. She's ordinary and you're special.</i> <i>That's not true, Severus.</i> <i>Gryffindor!</i> <i>- Hi, I'm James. - Hi, I'm Lily.</i> <i>Just like your father.</i> <i>Don't say a word against my father!</i> <i>Masters shall be reunited once more!</i> <i>Severus.</i> <i>No, don't kill me!</i> The prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke about a boy born at the end of the July. Yes, but he thinks it's her son! He intends to hunt them down and to kill them. Hide him... hide them all. I beg you! What would you give me in exchange, Severus? - Anything. - Harry... <i>Harry, you were so loved.</i> <i>So loved! Harry, mama loves you.</i> Dadda loves you. Harry, be safe. Be strong. <i>Avada Kedavra!</i> You said you would keep her safe. Lily and James... ..put their faith in the wrong person, Severus. Rather like you. The boy survives. He doesn't need protection, the Dark Lord has gone. The Dark Lord will return. And when he does, the boy will be in terrible danger! He has her eyes. If you truly loved her... No one, can know. <i>I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus.</i> <i>Your word?</i> <i>Can you risk your life every day to protect the boy?</i> <i>... He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals even that of his father and he seems to relish in his fame... </i> <i>Don't say a word against my father!</i> <i>James Potter, lazy, arrogant.</i> <i>- My father was a great man! - Your father was a swine!</i> Drink it, it will contain the curse to your hand, for the time being. - It will spread, Albus. - How long? Maybe a year. Don't ignore me, Severus. We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me. But should he fail, I should presume the Dark Lord will turn to you. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely. It will come a time, when Harry Potter, must be told something. But you must wait, until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable. Must be told what? On the night, Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry... And Lily Potter cast herself between them... ...the curse rebounded. When that happens, a part of Voldemort's soul... ...latched itself onto the only living thing it could find... ...Harry himself. There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes... There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind... A part of Voldemort lives inside him. So, when the time comes... ...the boy must die? Yes... yes. He must die. You've kept him alive, so he can die at the proper moment? You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter. Don't tell me now, that you've grown to care for the boy. <i>Expecto Patronum</i> Lily! After all this time? Always. So, when the time comes... ...the boy must die? Yes. He must die. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential. - Where've you been? - I thought you went to the forest. I'm going there now. Are you mad? No... You can't give yourself up to him. What is it, Harry? What is it you know? There's a reason I can hear them. The Horcruxes. I think I've known for a while. And I think you have, too. - I'll go with you. - No, kill the snake. Kill the snake, and then it's just him! I'm ready to die. Resurrection Stone. You've been so brave, sweetheart. Why are you here? All of you. We never left. Does... Does it hurt? Dying? Quicker than falling asleep. You're nearly there, son. I'm sorry. I never wanted any of you to die for me. And, Remus, your son? Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. One day, he'll understand. You'll stay with me? Until the end. And he won't be able to see you? No. We're here, you see. Stay close to me. Always. No sign of him, My Lord. I thought he would come. Harry, no! - What're yeh doin' here? - Quiet! Harry Potter... ...The Boy Who Lived... ...come to die. <i>Avada Kedavra</i> You can't help... Harry, you wonderful boy... You brave, brave man! Let us walk. Professor, what is that? Something beyond either of our help. A part of Voldemort sent here to die. And exactly where are we? I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are? Well, it looks like King's Cross station. Only cleaner... ....and without all the trains. King's Cross, is that right? This is, as they say, 'your' party. I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort... ...have been connected by something other than fate. Since that night in Godric's Hollow, all those years ago. So it's true then, sir. A part of him lives within me, doesn't it? Did. It's been just destroyed many moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself. You, were the Horcrux he never meant to make, Harry. - I have to go back, haven't I? - Oh, that's up to you. - I've a choice? - Oh, yes! We're in King's Cross, you say. I think if you so decide, you'll be able to board a train. And where would it take me? On. Voldemort has the Elder Wand. True. And the snake's still alive? Yes. And I've nothing to kill it with? Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry. To those who ask for it. I've always pride of myself on my ability to turn a phrase. Words are, in my not so humble opinion... ..are most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of inflicting injury and remedies. But I would in this case... ...amend my original statement to this: Help, will always be given at Hogwarts, To those who deserve it. Do not pity the dead, Harry... Pity the living. And above all... ....all those who live without love. Professor, my mother's Patronus... ...was a doe, wasn't it? As the same as Professor Snape's. It's curious, don't you think? Actually, if I think about it... ...it doesn't seem curious at all! I'll be going now, Harry. Professor? Is this all real? Or is it just happening inside my head? Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry. Why should that mean, that it's not real? Professor? What should I do? Professor! My Lord, My Lord... Are you hurt? I don't need your help. The boy... Is he dead? Is he alive? Draco, is he alive? Dead. Who is that? Hagrid's carrying? Neville, who is it? Harry Potter... ... is dead! - No! No! Silence! Stupid girl! Harry Potter... ...is dead! From this day forth... ...you'll put your faith in me. Harry Potter is dead! And now it's the time to declare yourself. Come forward and join us... ...or die! Draco! Draco. Draco. Come. Well done, Draco. Well done! Well, I must say I'd hoped for better. And who might you be, young man? Neville Longbottom. Well, Neville, I'm sure we can find a place for you in our rank. I'd like to say something. Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say. - Doesn't matter that Harry is gone. - Stand down, Neville! People die everyday! Friends, family. Yeah... We lost Harry tonight. He's still with us. In here. So as Fred, Remus... Tonks... All of them. They didn't die in vain. But you will. Because you're wrong! Harry's heart did beat for us. For all of us! It's not over! <i>Confringo</i> Come on! All remain into the castle. We have to kill the snake. Neville! Not my daughter, you bitch! Hey, you were right... ...when you told Professor Snape that wand was failing you. It will always fail... I killed Snape! But what if the wand never belonged to Snape? What if its allegiance is always to someone else? Oh, come on, Tom... Let's finish this the way we started. Together! Die! Harry! Why didn't it work for him? The Elder Wand? It answered to somebody else. When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... The wand never belonged to Snape. It was Draco, who disarmed Dumbledore that night in the Astronomy tower. From that moment on and the wand answered him, Until, the other night when I disarmed Draco. At Malfoy Manor. So, that means... It's mine! - What should we do with it? - We? Just saying, that's the Elder Wand. The most powerful wand in the world. With that, he'd be invincible. Together. - Bag? - Yeah. Jumper? I'm gonna miss you. Here they come. Dad? What if I am put in Slytherin? Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was the bravest man I've ever known. - But just say if I am... - Then Slytherin house... ...will have gained a wonderful young wizard. But listen... If it really means that much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account. - Really? - Really. -  Ready? -  Ready.",0.528144359588623,0.8369094133377075,0.241721723228693,0.14631831273436546,0.3366479054093361,0.1592632681131363
