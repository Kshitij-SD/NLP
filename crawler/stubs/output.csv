1 Harry,"I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall. Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumors true, Albus? I'm afraid so, professor. The good and the bad. - And the boy? - Hagrid is bringing him. Is it wise to trust Hagrid with something so important? Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life. Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall. - No problems, I trust, Hagrid? - No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep as we were flying over Bristol. Try not to wake him. There you go. Do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles. - They really are... - The only family he has. He'll be famous. Every child in our world will know his name. Exactly. He's far better off growing up away from all of that. Until he's ready. There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all. Good luck... ...Harry Potter. Up. Get up! Now! Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo! - Here he comes, the birthday boy. - Happy birthday, son. Cook breakfast. And try not to burn anything. - Yes, Aunt Petunia. - I want everything to be perfect... ...for my Dudley's special day! - Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy. - Yes, Uncle Vernon. Aren't they wonderful, darling? - How many are there? - 36. Counted them myself. 36?! But last year I had 37! - But some are bigger than last year's. - I don't care! This is what we're going to do. We're going to buy you two new presents. How's that, pumpkin? It should be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it. I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all... ...and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in. Make it move. Move! - Move! - He's asleep! He's boring. Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there... ...watching people press their ugly faces in on you. Can you hear me? It's just, I've never talked to a snake before. Do you? Do you talk to people often? You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there? Do you miss your family? I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents either. Mummy, Dad, you won't believe what this snake is doing! Thanks. Anytime. Snake! Mum! Mummy! Help me! My darling boy! How did you get in there? Who did this? How did you get in there? Is there a snake? It's all right, sweetheart. We'll get you out of these cold clothes. - What happened? - I swear, I don't know! The glass was there and then it was gone, like magic. There's no such thing as magic. Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk. - Dad, look! Harry's got a letter! - It's mine! Yours? Who'd be writing to you? No more mail through this letterbox. Have a lovely day at the office, dear. Shoo! Go on. Fine day, Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley? - Because there's no post on Sundays? - Right you are, Harry! No post on Sunday. No blasted letters today! No, sir. Not one single bloody letter. Not one! No, sir, not one blasted, miserable... Make it stop, please! Stop it! Mummy, what's happening? Give me that! Give me that letter! Get off! They're my letters! Let go of me! That's it! We're going away! Far away, where they can't find us! Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he? Make a wish, Harry. Who's there? Sorry about that. I demand that you leave at once. You are breaking and entering. Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry. You're a bit more along than I expected. Particularly in the middle. I'm not Harry. - I am. - Well, of course you are. Got something for you. Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same. Baked it myself, words and all. Thank you. It's not every day your young man turns 11, is it? Excuse me, but who are you? Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. - Of course, you know about Hogwarts. - Sorry, no. Didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all? Learned what? You're a wizard, Harry. - I'm a what? - A wizard. A good one, I'd wager, once you're trained up. No, you've made a mistake. I mean... ...I can't be a wizard. I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry. Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain, when you were angry or scared? ""Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to accept you... ...at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."" He will not be going! We swore we'd put a stop to all this rubbish. You knew? You knew all along and you never told me? Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. My mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. ""We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful?"" I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! Then she met that Potter, and then she had you... ...and I knew you would be the same. Just as strange, just as abnormal. And then she got herself blown up, and we got landed with you. Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash. A car crash? A car crash killed Lily and James Potter? - We had to say something. - It's an outrage! A scandal! He'll not be going. A great Muggle like you is going to stop him? Muggle? Non-magic folk. This boy's had his name down since he were born. He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry. He'll be under the finest headmaster Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore. I will not pay to have a crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks. Never insult Albus Dumbledore... ...in front of me. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. - I'm not allowed to do magic. - Okay. We're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. ""All students must be equipped with... ...one standard size 2 pewter cauldron... ...and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad."" Can we find all this in London? If you know where to go. Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume? No, thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business. Just helping Harry buy his school supplies. Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter! Welcome back, Mr. Potter. Welcome back. Doris Crockford. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last. Harry Potter. Can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you. Hello, professor. I didn't see you. Professor Quirrell will be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Oh, nice to meet you. Fearfully fascinating subject. Not that you need it, eh, Potter? Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Goodbye. - See, Harry? You're famous. - But why am I famous? All those people, how is it they know who I am? I'm not sure I'm the right person to tell you that. Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley. Here, you get your quills and ink. Over there, all your bits and bobs for doing wizardry. It's a world-class racing broom. Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet. But how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money. There's your money. Gringotts, the wizard bank. Ain't no safer place, not one. Except perhaps Hogwarts. Hagrid, what exactly are these things? They're goblins. Clever as they come, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stay close. Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal. And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key? Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Ha! There's the little devil. And there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about You-Know-What in vault you-know-which. Very well. Vault 687. Lamp, please. Key, please. Did you think your parents would leave you with nothing? - Vault 713. - What's in there, Hagrid? Can't tell you. Hogwarts business. Very secret. Stand back. Best not to mention this to anyone. I still need a wand. You want Ollivanders. There ain't no place better. Run along there and wait. I got one more thing to do. Hello? Hello? I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday... ...that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. Here we are. Give it a wave. Apparently not. Perhaps... ...this. No, no, definitely not. No matter. I wonder... Curious. Very curious. Sorry, but what's curious? I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It so happens that the phoenix... ...whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand... ...when its brother gave you that scar. And who owned that wand? We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it is clear... ...that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named... ...did great things. Terrible... ...yes, but great. Harry! Harry! Happy birthday. You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet. He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid. I know you do. First, and understand this because it's very important: Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago... ...there was a wizard who went as bad as you can go. His name was V... - His name was V... - Maybe if you wrote it down? No, I can't spell it. - All right, Voldemort. - Voldemort? It was dark times, Harry. <i>Voldemort started to gather some followers.</i> <i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i> <i>Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.</i> <i>Your parents fought against him.</i> <i>But nobody lived once he decided to kill them.</i> <i>Nobody, not one.</i> <i>Except you.</i> Me? Voldemort tried to kill me? Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, an evil curse. What happened to V? To You-Know-Who? Well, some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there still... ...too tired to carry on. But one thing's certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived. What are you looking at? Blimey, is that the time? I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore will be wanting his... Well, he'll be wanting to see me. Your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket, that's very important. ""Platform 93/4""? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says platform 93/4. There's no such thing, is there? Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. On your left. Can you tell me where I might find platform 93/4? Think you're being funny, do you? It's the same every year, packed with Muggles. - Muggles? - Platform 93/4, this way. All right, Percy, you first. Fred, you next. - He's not Fred, I am. - You call yourself our mother? I'm sorry, George. I'm only joking. I am Fred. Excuse me. Could you tell me how to? How to get onto the platform? Not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. All you do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. - Best to run if you're nervous. - Good luck. Excuse me. Do you mind? Everywhere else is full. Not at all. I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley. I'm Harry. Harry Potter. So it's true! I mean, do you really have the? - The what? - The scar? Wicked! - Anything off the trolley, dears? - No, thanks. I'm all set. We'll take the lot. - Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans? - They mean every flavor. There's chocolate and peppermint and also... ...spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a booger-flavored one once. - Are they real frogs? - It's a spell. You want the cards. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I've got about 500 meself. Watch it! That's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them. - I've got Dumbledore! - I got about six of him. Hey, he's gone! You can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? This is Scabbers. Pathetic, isn't he? A little. Fred gave me a spell to turn him yellow. Want to see? Yeah. Has anyone seen a toad? - A boy named Neville's lost one. - No. Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see, then. <i>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</i> <i>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</i> Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've only tried a few simple ones myself... ...but they've all worked for me. For example: <i>Oculus Reparo.</i> That's better, isn't it? Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter! I'm Hermione Granger. And you are? - I'm Ron Weasley. - Pleasure. You two better change into robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your nose. Did you know? Just there. Right, then. First years, this way, please! Come on, first years, don't be shy. Come on now, hurry up. - Hello, Harry. - Hi, Hagrid. Right, then. This way to the boats. Come on now, follow me. Wicked. Welcome to Hogwarts. Shortly, you'll pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff... ...Ravenclaw and Slytherin. While you're here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you points. Any rule-breaking and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points wins the house cup. Trevor! Sorry. The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily. It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. Harry Potter? This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. Think my name's funny, do you? I've no need to ask yours. Red hair and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. You'll find out some wizarding families are better than others. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks. We're ready for you now. Follow me. The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched to look like the night sky. <i>I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.</i> Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin... ...Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words. I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce. The first years, please note... ...that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you... ...that the third-floor corridor is out of bounds... ...to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you. When I call your name, you will come forth. I shall place the Sorting Hat on your head... ...and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger. Oh, no. Okay, relax. Mental, that one, I'm telling you. Right, then. Right. Okay. Gryffindor! Draco Malfoy. Slytherin! Every wizard who went bad was in Slytherin. Susan Bones. Harry, what is it? Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine. Let's see... I know! Hufflepuff! Ronald Weasley. Another Weasley! I know just what to do with you. Gryffindor! Harry Potter. Difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh, yes. And a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you? Not Slytherin, not Slytherin! Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It's all here, in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that. No? Well, if you're sure. Better be... ...Gryffindor! Your attention, please. Let the feast begin. I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out. Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell? Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house. - What's he teach? - Potions. But he fancies the Dark Arts. He's been after Quirrell's job for years. Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor. It's the Bloody Baron! Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer? Dismal. Once again, my request to join the Headless Hunt has been denied. I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick. I prefer Sir Nicholas, if you don't mind. ""Nearly"" headless? How can you be nearly headless? Like this. Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you. Ravenclaw, follow me. This way. This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Keep an eye on the staircases. They like to change. Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. That picture's moving. - Look at that one. - I think she fancies you. - Look! - Who's that girl? Welcome to Hogwarts. Password? Caput Draconis. Follow me, everyone. Keep up. Quickly, come on. Gather around here. Welcome to the Gryffindor common room. Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left. Girls, the same on your right. Your belongings have already been brought up. Made it! Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late? - That was bloody brilliant! - Thank you for that assessment. It'd be better if I transfigured Mr. Potter and you into a watch. - Then one of you might be on time. - We got lost. Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats. There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate... ...the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few... ...who possess the predisposition... ...I can teach you how to bewitch the mind... ...and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame... ...brew glory and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts with abilities... ...so formidable that you feel confident enough... ...to not pay attention. Mr. Potter. Our new celebrity. What would I get if I added root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? You don't know? Let's try again. Where would you look if I asked you to find a bezoar? I don't know, sir. What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane? I don't know, sir. Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything... ...is it, Mr. Potter? <i>Eye of rabbit, harp string hum Turn this water into rum</i> <i>Eye of rabbit...</i> What's Seamus trying to do to the water? Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before... Mail's here. Can I borrow this? Thanks. Look, Neville's got a Remembrall. I've read about those. The smoke turns red when you've forgotten something. The problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten. Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen. ""Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches... ...Gringotts goblins acknowledge the breach but insist nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had been emptied earlier that same day."" That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to. - Good afternoon, class. - Good afternoon, Madam Hooch. Good afternoon, Amanda. Good afternoon. Welcome to your first flying lesson. What are you waiting for? Step up to your broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand over the broom and say, ""Up."" Up! Up. Up. Up. Up! With feeling. Shut up, Harry. Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. Grip it tight. You don't wanna be sliding off the end. When I blow my whistle, I want you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment... ...then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle. Three, two... Mr. Longbottom. - Mr. Longbottom! - Down, down! Neville! Come back down this instant! Everyone out of the way! Is he all right? Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist. Poor boy. Come on now, up you get. Keep your feet on the ground while I take him to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air... ...the one riding it will be expelled before they can say Quidditch. Did you see his face? If he had squeezed this, he'd have remembered to fall on his arse. Give it here, Malfoy. No. I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. How about on the roof? What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach? Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said. Besides, you don't know how to fly. What an idiot. Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom! Is that so? Have it your way, then. - Nice going, Harry. - That was wicked, Harry! Harry Potter! Follow me. You wait here. Professor Quirrell, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment? Yes, of course. Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker. Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well. Seeker? But first years never make the house teams. - You must be the youngest player in... - A century, McGonagall says. Well done, Harry. Wood's just told us. Fred and George are on the team. Beaters. Our job is to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises. Rough game, Quidditch. But no one's died in years. Someone vanishes occasionally. But they'll turn up in a month or two. Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game there is, and you'll be great too. I've never played. What if I make a fool of myself? You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood. You never told me your father was a Seeker too. I didn't know. I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do. Who doesn't? What's happening? The staircases change, remember? - Let's go this way. - Before the staircase moves again. Does anybody feel like we shouldn't be here? We're not supposed to be here. This is the third floor. It's forbidden. Let's go. - It's Filch's cat! - Run! Quick, let's hide through that door! - It's locked! - We're done for! Move over! <i>Alohomora.</i> Get in. <i>Alohomora?</i> <i>Standard Book of Spells, chapter seven.</i> Anyone here, my sweet? Come on. - Filch is gone. - He thinks this door's locked. - It was locked. - And for good reason. What are they doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school? Didn't you see what it was standing on? I wasn't looking at its feet! I was preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. There were three! It was standing on a trap door. It wasn't there by accident. - It's guarding something. - Guarding something? That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed... ...before you come up with another idea to get us killed. Or worse, expelled. She needs to sort out her priorities. Quidditch is easy to understand. Each team has seven players. Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls. This one's called the Quaffle. The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those hoops. The Keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. With me so far? I think so. What are those? You better take this. Careful now, it's coming back. Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater. What was that? Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are a Seeker. The only thing I want you to worry about is this. The Golden Snitch. - I like this ball. - You like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see. What do I do with it? You catch it. Before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game's over. You catch this, Potter, and we win. One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation... ...or the ability to make objects fly. Do you have your feathers? Good. Now, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing. The swish and flick. Everyone. The swish and flick. Good. Oh, and enunciate. <i>Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go, then.</i> <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i> <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i> No, stop, stop, stop! You're going to take someone's eye out. <i>Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.</i> You do it then, if you're so clever. Go on, go on. <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i> Well done! See here, everyone, Miss Granger's done it! Splendid! Well done, dear. I think we're going to need another feather over here. <i>""It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.""</i> She's a nightmare, honestly! No wonder she hasn't got any friends. I think she heard you. Where's Hermione? Parvati said she wouldn't come out of the bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon, crying. Troll in the dungeon! Troll in the dungeon! Thought you ought to know. Silence! Everyone will please not panic! Now... ...prefects will lead their house back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons. Gryffindors, keep up, please, and stay alert. How could a troll get in? Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. - What? - Hermione! She doesn't know. I think the troll's left the dungeon. It's going into the girls' bathroom. Hermione, move! Help! Help! Hey, pea brain! Help! Do something! - What? - Anything! - Hurry up! - Swish and flick. <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i> Cool. Is it dead? I don't think so. Just knocked out. Troll boogers. Oh, my goodness! Explain yourselves, both of you! - Well, what it is... - It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. Miss Granger? I went looking for the troll. I thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me, I'd probably be dead. Be that as it may, it was an extremely foolish thing to do. I expected more rational behavior and am very disappointed in you. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor... ...for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen... ...I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many first-year students could take on a troll... ...and live to tell the tale. Five points... ...will be awarded to each of you... ...for sheer dumb luck. Perhaps you ought to go. It might wake up. Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on. Ron's right. You'll need your strength today. I'm not hungry. Good luck today, Potter. You've proven yourself against a troll. A game of Quidditch should be easy work. Even if it is against Slytherin. - That explains the blood. - Blood? Last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion... ...so he could get past that dog. But he got bit, that's why he's limping. But why would anyone go near that dog? At Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of the vault. Said it was Hogwarts business, very secret. You're saying... That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants. - Bit early for mail, isn't it? - But I never get mail. Let's open it. It's a broomstick. That's not just a broomstick, it's a Nimbus 2000! But who? - Scared, Harry? - A little. It's all right. I felt the same way before my first game. - What happened? - I don't really remember. I took a Bludger to the head two minutes in. Woke up in hospital a week later. Welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season. Today's game, Slytherin versus Gryffindor! The players take their positions... ...as Madam Hooch steps onto the field to begin the game! Now, I want a nice, clean game... ...from all of you! The Bludgers are up, followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the Snitch is worth 150 points. The Seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game. The Quaffle is released and the game begins! Angelina Johnson scores! Ten points for Gryffindor! Well done! Slytherin takes the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint. Another 10 points to Gryffindor! Give me that! Take that side! What's going on with Harry's broomstick? It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom! - Jinxing the broom? What do we do? - Leave it to me. Come on, Hermione! <i>Lacarnum Inflamarae.</i> Fire! You're on fire! Go, go, go, go! Looks like he's gonna be sick. He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch! Gryffindor wins! Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom? Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog? - Who told you about Fluffy? - Fluffy? - That thing has a name? - Of course he has a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irishman. I lent him to Dumbledore to guard... Shouldn't have said that. No more questions! That's top-secret. But whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it. Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher. Teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking. Exactly. Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel. Nicholas Flamel? I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. Nicholas Flamel. Who's Nicholas Flamel? I don't know. <i>Merry Christmas Merry Christmas</i> <i>Ring the Hogwart bell</i> <i>Merry Christmas Merry Christmas</i> <i>Cast a Christmas spell</i> Knight to e5. Queen to e5. That's totally barbaric! That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed. I see you haven't. Change of plans. My parents went to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. - He's studying dragons there. - Good. You can help Harry. He's going to the library to look up Nicholas Flamel. We've looked a hundred times! Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas. I think we've had a bad influence on her. Harry, wake up! Come on, Harry, wake up! - Happy Christmas, Harry. - Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing? Oh, my mum made it. Looks like you've got one too. - I've got presents? - Yeah. There they are. ""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."" - What is it? - Some kind of cloak. Well, let's see, then. Put it on. My body's gone! I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak! I'm invisible? They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you. There was no name. It just said, ""Use it well."" <i>Famous Fire-Eaters. Fifteenth-Century Fiends.</i> Flamel. Nicholas Flamel. Where are you? Who's there? I know you're in there. You can't hide. Who is it? Show yourself. Severus, I... You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell. - I don't know what you mean. - You know perfectly well what I mean. We'll have another little chat soon. When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie. Professors. I found this in the restricted section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed. Mum? Dad? Ron, you've really gotta see this! Ron, you've gotta see this! Ron, come on, get out of bed! - Why? - There's something you've got to see! Come on! Come! Come look, it's my parents! I only see us. Look in properly. Go on, stand there. - There. You see them, don't you? - That's me! Only I'm head boy. And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup. And bloody hell! I'm Quidditch captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future? How can it? Both my parents are dead. Back again, Harry? I see that you, like many before you... ...have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth... ...would look in the mirror and see only himself... ...exactly as he is. So then, it shows us what we want. Whatever we want. Yes. And no. It shows us nothing more or less... ...than the deepest and most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, Harry, who have never known your family... ...you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge... ...or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it. Even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home. And I must ask you... ...not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams... ...and forget to live. I had you looking in the wrong section. How could I be so stupid? I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading. This is light? Of course! Here it is! Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone. The what? Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It'll transform any metal into pure gold... ...and produces the Elixir of Life which will make the drinker immortal."" - Immortal? - It means you'll never die. I know what it means! ""The only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel... ...the noted alchemist who last year celebrated his 665th birthday."" That's what Fluffy's guarding. That's what's under the trap door. The Philosopher's Stone. Don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no state to entertain. We know about the Philosopher's Stone. - We think Snape's trying to steal it. - Are you still on about him? We know he's after it. We don't know why. Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone. He won't steal it. What? You heard. Come on, I'm a bit preoccupied today. Wait a minute. ""One of the teachers""? There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? - Spells, enchantments. - Right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me. Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Ain't a soul knows how, except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I should not have told you that. - Hagrid, what exactly is that? - That? It's... I know what that is! But, Hagrid, how did you get one? I won it. Off a stranger I met down at the pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid of it, as a matter of fact. Is that... ...a dragon? That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback. My brother works with these in Romania. Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him. Look, he knows his mummy. Hello, Norbert. - Norbert? - He's gotta have a name, don't he? Don't you, Norbert? He'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. Who's that? Malfoy. Oh, dear. Hagrid always wanted a dragon. Told me so the first time I met him. It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows. - I don't understand. Is that bad? - It's bad. Good evening. Nothing, I repeat, nothing... ...gives a student the right to walk about at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken. - 50?! - Each. To ensure it doesn't happen again... ...all four of you will receive detention. Excuse me, professor, perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said the four of us. No, you heard me correctly. Honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will join your classmates in detention. A pity they let the old punishments die. Was a time detention found you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the Dark Forest. A sorry lot, this, Hagrid. Good God, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you? Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony. That's good, isn't it? He's with his own kind. What if he don't like Romania? What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby. For God's sake, pull yourself together. You're going into the Forest. Got to have your wits about you. The Forest? I thought that was a joke. We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are... ...werewolves. There's more than werewolves in those trees. You can be sure of that. Nighty-night. Right. Let's go. Hagrid, what is that? What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been hurt bad by something. So, it's our job to go and find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, come with me. And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. Okay. Then I get Fang. Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. Wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were scared. I'm not scared, Potter. Do you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared! What is it, Fang? Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The Forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you. What was that thing you saved me from? A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking its blood will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. For you have slain something so pure... ...that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life. - Who would choose such a life? - Can you think of no one? Do you mean to say that that thing that killed the unicorn... ...that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort? Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment? The Philosopher's Stone. Harry! Hello there, Firenze. See you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck. You mean, You-Know-Who is out there right now in the Forest? But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants it for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll come back. But if he comes back... ...you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you? If he'd had the chance, he might have tried tonight. And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final. Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore is around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore is around, you can't be touched. I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were frightful, but I found that enjoyable. Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry? - My scar. It keeps burning. - It's happened before. - Not like this. - You should see the nurse. I think it's a warning. It means danger's coming. - Of course! - What is it? Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon... ...and a stranger just happens to have one? How many people wander around with dragon eggs? Why didn't I see it before? Who gave you the egg? What did he look like? I never saw his face. He kept his hood up. You and this stranger must have talked. He wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."" - Was he interested in Fluffy? - Of course he was interested. How often do you come across a three-headed dog? But I told him, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him."" Take Fluffy, for example. Play him music and he falls straight to sleep. I shouldn't have told you that. Where are you going? We have to see Dumbledore. Immediately! I'm afraid he's not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left. He's gone? But this is important! This is about the Philosopher's Stone! - How do you know? - Someone's going to try and steal it. I don't know how you know, but I assure you it is well protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. That was no stranger Hagrid met. It was Snape. Which means he knows how to get past Fluffy. - And with Dumbledore gone... - Good afternoon. What would three young Gryffindors... ...be doing inside on a day like this? - We were just... - You ought to be careful. People will think you're... ...up to something. Now what do we do? We go down the trap door. Tonight. Trevor. Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here! Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, aren't you? - Neville, listen. We were... - No, I won't let you! You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again. I'll fight you. <i>Neville, I'm really sorry about this. Petrificus Totalus.</i> You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant, but scary. Let's go. - Sorry. - It's for your own good, you know. - You stood on my foot! - Sorry. <i>Alohomora.</i> Wait a minute. He's... ...snoring. Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. It's got horrible breath. - We have to move its paw. - What? Come on! Okay. Push. I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. If something bad happens, get yourselves out. Does it seem a bit quiet to you? The harp. It's stopped playing. Jump! Lucky this plant thing's here, really. Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster. Kill us faster? Oh, now I can relax! Hermione! - Now what are we gonna do? - Just relax! - Hermione, where are you? - Do what I say! Trust me. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - He's not relaxing, is he? - Apparently not. - We've gotta do something. - What? I remember reading something in Herbology. Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. It's deadly fun... ...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! It hates sunlight. <i>Lumus Solem.</i> - Ron, you okay? - Yeah. Lucky we didn't panic. Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology. What is that? I don't know. Sounds like wings. Curious. I've never seen birds like these. They're not birds. They're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. - What's this all about? - I don't know. Strange. <i>Alohomora!</i> Well, it was worth a try. What will we do? There must be a thousand keys. We want a big, old-fashioned one. Probably rusty. I see it! The one with the broken wing. What's wrong? It's too simple. Go on! If Snape could catch it on that old broomstick, you can. You're the youngest Seeker in a century. This complicates things a bit. Catch the key! Hurry up! I don't like this. I don't like this at all. Where are we? A graveyard. This is no graveyard. It's a chessboard. There's the door. Now what do we do? It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. Harry, you take the empty bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the queen-side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. What happens now? Well, white moves first. And then... ...we play. Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like... ...real wizard's chess, do you? You there, d5. Yes, Hermione. I think this is gonna be exactly like wizard's chess. Castle to e4! Pawn to c3! - Wait a minute. - You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the queen will take me. Then you're free to check the king. - No. Ron, no! - What is it? - He's going to sacrifice himself. - No, there must be another way! Do you wanna stop Snape from getting that Stone or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You. Knight to h3. Check. Ron! No, don't move! Don't forget, we're still playing. Checkmate. Take care of Ron. Then go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on. You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard. You really are. Not as good as you. Me? Books and cleverness. There are more important things. Friendship and bravery. And, Harry, just be careful. You? No, it can't be. Snape, he was the... Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to him, who would suspect... ...poor, stuttering Professor Quirrell? But that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me. No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! If Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact... ...I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his countercurse. Snape was trying to save me? I knew you were a danger to me, especially after Halloween. - Then you let the troll in! - Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone ran about, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it? Use the boy. Come here, Potter! Now! Tell me, what do you see? What is it? What do you see? I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup. He lies. Tell the truth! What do you see? - Let me speak to him. - Master, you are not strong enough. I have strength enough for this. Harry Potter... ...we meet again. Voldemort. Yes. You see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me... ...but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. Stop him! Don't be a fool. Why suffer an horrific death... ...when you can join me and live? Never! Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry... ...would you like to see your mother and father again? Together... ...we can bring them back. All I ask is for something in return. That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power... ...and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the Stone! You liar! Kill him! - What is this magic? - Fool, get the Stone! Good afternoon, Harry. - Tokens from your admirers? - Admirers? What happened in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a secret. So, naturally, the whole school knows. I see that your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble... ...of opening your Chocolate Frogs. Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione? Fine. They're both just fine. - What happened to the Stone? - Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I have had a little chat... ...and agreed it was best all around. But then, Flamel, he'll die, won't he? He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die. How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror and... You see, only a person... ...who wanted to find the Stone, find it... ...but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me, that is saying something. Does that mean, with the Stone gone, that Voldemort can never come back? I'm afraid... ...there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why... ...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark. No, this kind of mark cannot be seen. - It lives in your very skin. - What is it? Love, Harry. Love. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one. And since then, I've lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe... ...with a nice toffee. Alas! Earwax. - All right there, Ron? - All right. You? All right. Hermione? Never better. Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding. And the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. Third place, Hufflepuff with 352 points. In second place... ...Ravenclaw with 426 points. And in first place... ...with 472 points, Slytherin house. Nice one, mate. Yes, well done, Slytherin. Well done. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last-minute points to award. To Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect... ...while others were in grave peril... ...50 points. Good job. Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best-played game of chess... ...that Hogwarts has seen these many years, 50 points. And third... ...to Mr. Harry Potter... ...for pure nerve and outstanding courage... ...I award Gryffindor house 60 points. We're tied with Slytherin! Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies... ...but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points... ...to Neville Longbottom. Assuming that my calculations are correct... ...I believe that a change of decoration is in order. Gryffindor wins the house cup. Come on, now. Hurry up, you'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Come on, hurry up. - Come on, Harry. - One minute. Thought you were leaving without saying goodbye, did you? This is for you. Thanks, Hagrid. Go on. On with you. On with you now. Oh, listen, Harry. If that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief... ...you could always threaten him... ...with a nice pair of ears to go with his tail. But we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that. I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it? I'm not going home.

2 Harry,"I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. - Besides, if Uncle Vernon... - Harry Potter! Now you've done it. He's in there. Vernon? I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go. But she's bored. If I could only let her out for an hour or two. So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir. But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends. Not one... ...all summer. Who would want to be friends with you? I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table... ...even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... ...purely out of the goodness of our hearts. Not now. It's for when the Masons arrive. Which should be any minute. Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...? In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home. - Good. And, Dudley, you will be...? - I'll be waiting to open the door. Excellent. And you? I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist. Too right, you will. With any luck, this could be the day I make the biggest deal of my career... ...and you will not mess it up. Harry Potter, such an honor it is. - Who are you? - Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf. Not to be rude or anything... ...but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom. Yes, sir. Dobby understands. It's just that Dobby has come to tell you... It is difficult, sir. Dobby wonders where to begin. - Why don't you sit down? - Sit down? Sit down? Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything. Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir... ...but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal. You can't have met many decent wizards then. No, I haven't. That was an awful thing to say. - Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! - Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush. Dobby, please, stop. Don't mind that. It's just the cat. - Bad Dobby. - Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet. Are you all right? Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. - Your family? - The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here... But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. Harry Potter must not go back... ...to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen. What terrible things? Who's plotting them? Can't say. - Okay, I understand. You can't say. - Don't make me talk. L... - Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down. - Bad Dobby. So when they arrive at the ninth hole... Give me the lamp. Dobby, stop! - Let me go. - Get in there and keep quiet. - What the devil are you doing up here? - I was just... You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. Sorry. One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy. - And fix that door. - Yes, sir. See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. - It's the only place I've got friends. - Friends who don't write to Harry Potter? Well, I expect they've been... Hang on. How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me? Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him... ...Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir. - Give me those. Now. - No! Dobby, get back here. Dobby, please, no. Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school. I can't. Hogwarts is my home. Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good. It spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this building. One plumber said, ""Look at all that water. "" The second plumber said, ""Yes, and that's just the top of it. "" I'm so sorry. It's my nephew. He's very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs. You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never! Hiya, Harry. Ron. Fred. George. What are you all doing here? Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on, get your trunk. You better stand back. Let's go. - What was that? - What was it? Potter! Dad, what's going on? Go. Go. Go. Dad, hurry up. - Come on. - Come on, Harry, hurry up. Petunia, he's escaping! - I've got you, Harry. - Come here! - Let go of me! - No, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere. - Get off! - Drive! - Right. - Right! No! No! No! No! Dad! Damn. By the way, Harry, happy birthday. Come on. Okay, come on. Okay, come on. - Think it'd be all right if we had some? - Yeah, Mum will never know. It's not much, but it's home. I think it's brilliant. Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you, dear. Beds empty. No note. Car gone. You could have died. You could have been seen. Of course, I don't blame you, Harry, dear. They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window. Well, you best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley. Come on, Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in. That's it. There we go. - Mummy, have you seen my jumper? - Yes, dear, it was on the cat. Hello. What did I do? Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying, really. - Morning, Weasleys. - Morning, Dad. - What a night. Nine raids. Nine! - Raids? Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating. Well, now. And who are you? Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir. Harry Potter. Good Lord. Are you really? Well, Ron has told us all about you, of course. When did he get here? This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night. Did you really? How did it go? I mean... That was very wrong indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck? Well, that'll be Errol with the post. Fetch it, will you, Percy, please? - Errol. - He's always doing that. Look, it's our Hogwarts letters. They've sent us Harry's as well. Dumbledore must know you're here. Doesn't miss a trick, that man. - No. - This lot won't come cheap. - The spell books alone are expensive. - We'll manage. There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley. Right. Here we are, Harry. You go first, dear. But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum. Floo powder? You go first, Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go. That's it. Diagon Alley. You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it. Mind your head. That's right. Now, take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly. Diagonally. - What did he say, dear? - Diagonally. I thought he did. - Not lost, are you, my dear? - I'm fine, thank you. I was just going... Come with us. We'll help you find your way back. - No. Please... - Harry? Hagrid! What do you think you're doing down here? Come on. You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place. Don't want no one to see you there. People will think you're up to no good. I was lost, I... Hang on. What were you doing down there then? Me? I was... I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent. They're ruining all the school cabbages. Harry. Hagrid. Hello, Hermione. - It's so good to see you. - It's great to see you too. What did you do to your glasses? <i>Oculus Reparo.</i> I definitely need to remember that one. You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it. - Okay, bye. - Thank you. Bye. Come on, everyone's been so worried. Harry. Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart. Here he is. Mum fancies him. Make way there, please. Let me by, madam. Thank you. <i>Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet.</i> It can't be. Harry Potter? Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam. Nice big smile, Harry. Together, you and I rate the front page. Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning... <i>...to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me...</i> ...which, incidentally, is currently celebrating... <i>...its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list...</i> ...he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving... ...with my entire collected works... ...free of charge. Now, ladies? Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it. I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a bookshop without making the front page. Leave him alone. Look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend. Now, now, Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter. Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me. Your scar is legend. As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you. Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer. You must be very brave to mention his name. Or very foolish. Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. And you must be Miss Granger. Yes, Draco has told me all about you. And your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me see. Red hair, vacant expressions... ...tatty, secondhand book. You must be the Weasleys. It's mad in here. Let's go outside. - Well, well, well. Weasley senior. - Lucius. Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime... ...but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard... ...if they don't even pay you well for it? We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy. Clearly. Associating with Muggles. And I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work. See you at school. - 10:58, come on. - The train will be leaving any moment. Fred, George, Percy, you first. Okay. After you, dear. Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry. Let's go. - What do you two think you're doing? - Sorry. Lost control of the trolley. - Why can't we get through? - I don't know. The gateway has sealed itself for some reason. The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it. Harry, if we can't get through... ...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back. Maybe we should just go and wait by the car. The car. Ron, I should tell you... ...most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car. Right. Okay. Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty. Come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train. Okay. All we need to do is catch up with the train. We can't be far behind. - Do you hear that? - We must be getting close. Hold on. Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on! I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty. - I think we found the train. - Yeah. Welcome home. Up! Up! It's not working! Up! Ron, mind that tree! Stop! Stop! Stop! - My wand. Look at my wand. - Be thankful it's not your neck. - What's happening? - I don't know. Come on, go! Fast! Scabbers, you're okay. The car! Dad's gonna kill me. See you, Hedwig. So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom... ...we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4... ...we almost get killed by a tree... Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year. Well, take a good look, lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Oh, dear, we are in trouble. You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow... ...that's been on these grounds since before you were born. Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us. Silence. I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me... ...the both of you would be on the train home tonight. - As it is... - They are not. Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall. Headmaster... ...these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. - As such... - I am well aware of our bylaws... ...having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house... ...it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action. We'll go and get our stuff, then. What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley? You're going to expel us, aren't you? Not today, Mr. Weasley... ...but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention. Morning, everyone. - Good morning, everyone. - Good morning, Professor Sprout. Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second years. Gather around, everyone. Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger? Mandrake, or Mandragora... ...is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it. Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings... ...their cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for hours, which is why I have given you earmuffs... ...for auditory protection. So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly. Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly. You pull it sharply up out of the pot. Got it? And... ...now you dunk it down into the other pot... ...and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm. Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs. - No, ma'am, he's just fainted. - Yes, well, just leave him there. Right, on we go. Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up. - There's Nearly Headless Nick. - Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater. Hello, Sir Nicholas. Say it. I'm doomed. - You're doomed. - Hi, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too. Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you. Ron, is that your owl? Bloody bird's a menace. Oh, no. Look, everyone. Weasley's got himself a Howler. Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible. <i>Ronald Weasley!</i> <i>How dare you steal that car! I am absolutely disgusted!</i> <i>Your father's now facing an inquiry at work...</i> <i>...nd it's entirely your fault!</i> <i>If you put another toe out of line...</i> <i>...we'll bring you straight home!</i> <i>And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor.</i> <i>Your father and I are so proud.</i> Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart... ...Order of Merlin, Third Class... ...honorary member of the Dark Force Defense League... ...and five times winner... <i>...of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award.</i> But I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Now, be warned. It is my job to arm you... ...against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them. Cornish pixies? Freshly caught Cornish pixies. Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan... ...but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them. Come on now, round them up. They're only pixies. - You just stay there! - Please, get me down! - Get off me! - Stop. Hold still! <i>Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</i> I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage. What do we do now? <i>Immobulus!</i> Why is it always me? I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer. What...? I don't believe it. - Where you think you're going, Flint? - Quidditch practice. - I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today. - Easy, Wood. I've got a note. I smell trouble. ""I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team... ...permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker. "" You've got a new Seeker. Who? - Malfoy? - That's right. And that's not all that's new this year. Those are Nimbus 2001 s. How did you get those? A gift from Draco's father. You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best. At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent. No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood. You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs! You okay, Ron? Say something. - Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry? - No, Colin, get out of the way. Let's take him to Hagrid's. He'll know what to do. This calls for a specialist's equipment. Nothing to do but wait till it stops, I'm afraid. - Okay. - Better out than in. - Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway? - Malfoy. He called Hermione... Well, I don't know exactly what it means. He called me a Mudblood. - He did not. - What's a Mudblood? It means ""dirty blood. "" Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation. See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family... ...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood. That's horrible. It's disgusting. And it's codswallop to boot. Dirty blood. Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood or less. More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do. Come here. Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute. Harry, Harry, Harry. Can you possibly imagine... ...a better way to serve detention... ...than by helping me to answer my fan mail? Not really. Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that. <i>Come.</i> <i>Come...</i> <i>...to me.</i> - What? - Sorry? That voice. Voice? - Didn't you hear it? - What are you talking about, Harry? I think you're getting a bit drowsy. And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the time. We've been here nearly four hours. Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun. Spooky. <i>Blood.</i> <i>I smell blood.</i> <i>Let me rip you.</i> <i>Let me kill you.</i> <i>Kill!</i> <i>Kill!</i> <i>- Kill! - Harry!</i> - Did you hear it? - Hear what? - That voice. - Voice? What voice? I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just... <i>It's time.</i> It's moving. I think it's going to kill. - Kill? - Harry, wait! Not so fast! Strange. - I've never seen spiders act like that. - I don't like spiders. What's that? ""The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware. "" It's written in blood. Oh, no. It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris. ""Enemies of the Heir, beware. "" You'll be next, Mudbloods. What's going on here? Go on. Make way, make way. Potter? What are you...? Mrs. Norris? - You've murdered my cat. - No. No. I'll kill you. - I'll kill you! - Argus! Argus, I... Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except... ...you three. Ravenclaws, follow me. She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified. Thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her. But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say. Ask him. It's him that's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall. It's not true, sir. I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris. - Rubbish. - Lf I might, headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. However... ...the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner. I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail. That's why Ron and I went looking for him, professor. We'd just found him when he said... - Yes, Miss Granger? - When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris. - Innocent until proven guilty, Severus. - My cat has been Petrified. - I want to see some punishment! - We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime... ...I strongly recommend caution... ...to all. - It's a bit strange, isn't it? - Strange? You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear... ...and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange. Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean? Are you mad? No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign. She's right, you know. Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals... ...into water goblets. Like so. <i>One, two, three. Vera Verto.</i> Now it's your turn. Who would like to go first? <i>Mr. Weasley. ""One, two, three. Vera Verto. ""</i> <i>Vera Verto!</i> That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. - Yes, Miss Granger? - Professor... ...I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets. Very well. You all know, of course... ...that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago... ...by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff... ...Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. - One did not. - Three guesses who. Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective... ...about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, pure-bloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend... ...Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle... ...known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it... ...until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school. The Heir alone... ...would be able to open the Chamber... ...and unleash the horror within, and by so doing... ...purge the school of all those who... ...in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic. Muggle-borns. Naturally, the school has been searched many times. No such chamber has been found. Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber? The Chamber is said to be home to something... ...that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home... ...of a monster. Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets? Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are. If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means... The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it? Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum? - Lf you're talking about Malfoy... - Of course. You heard him. ""You'll be next, Mudbloods. "" I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin? Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries. Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling. Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules... ...and it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous. Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion. ""Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker... ...to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another. "" You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle? - Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything. - Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. - How long will it take to make? - A month. A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin... ...he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then. I know. But it's the only plan we've got. Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30. Yeah! Yeah! All right there, Scarhead? Watch yourself, Harry! Wood, look out! Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger. That's been tampered with, that has. I'll stop it. No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry. Training for the ballet, Potter? You'll never catch me, Potter. Let's go. <i>Harry Potter has caught the Snitch. Gryffindor wins!</i> <i>Finite Incantatem!</i> - Thank you. - Are you okay? No. I think my arm is broken. Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straightaway. - Not you. - Boy doesn't know what he's saying. This won't hurt a bit. <i>Brackium Emendo!</i> Yes, well, that can sometimes happen... ...but the point is... ...you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken. Broken? There's no bones left. Much more flexible, though. Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss. You can go. Out of my way. Should have been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back... You will be able to, won't you? I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business. What do you expect? Pumpkin juice? <i>Kill.</i> <i>Kill.</i> <i>Time to kill.</i> Hello. Dobby? Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby. Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train. It was you. You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through. Indeed. Yes, sir. - You nearly got Ron and me expelled. - At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home. Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see... Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me? Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands. You better clear off before my bones come back, or I might strangle you. Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home. I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me? Not kill you, sir. Never kill you. Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed... ...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin. Why do you wear that thing, Dobby? This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elf's enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here... ...now that history is to repeat itself. Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before? I shouldn't have said that. - Bad Dobby! Bad! - Stop it! Stop it, Dobby! Tell me. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now? Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe. No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it? Put him here. - What happened? - There's been another attack. I think he's been Petrified, Madam Pomfrey. Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker. What can this mean, Albus? It means... ...that our students are in great danger. - What should I tell the staff? - The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again. Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before? Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. - Now he's taught Draco how to do it. - Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure. Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight... ...in the middle of the girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught? No. No one ever comes in here. - Why? - Moaning Myrtle. Who? Moaning Myrtle. - Who's Moaning Myrtle? - I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't expect you to know me. Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable... ...moping Moaning Myrtle? She's a little sensitive. Gather round! Gather round. Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent. In light of the dark events of recent weeks... ...Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club... ...to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves... ...as I myself have done on countless occasions. For full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant... ...Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration. I don't want any of you youngsters to worry. You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear. One. Two. <i>- Three! - Expelliarmus!</i> - Do you think he's all right? - Who cares? An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape... ...but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy. Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students... ...to block unfriendly spells, professor. An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Let's have a volunteer pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you? Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps? - Good luck, Potter. - Thank you, sir. Wands at the ready. - Scared, Potter? - You wish. On the count of three... ...cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm. We don't want any accidents here. One. <i>- Two. - Everte Statum!</i> <i>Rictusempra!</i> I said disarm only. <i>Serpensortia!</i> Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you. <i>Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte Ascendare!</i> <i>Vipera Evanesca.</i> What are you playing at? You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us? - I'm a what? - You can talk to snakes. I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it. No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad. What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin... - That's what you said to it. - You were there. You heard me. I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language. I spoke a different language? But I didn't realize... How can I speak a language without knowing I can? I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too. Exactly. Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson. But I'm not. I can't be. He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know, you could be. I'll see you back in the common room. <i>I want blood.</i> <i>They all must die.</i> <i>Kill.</i> <i>Kill.</i> <i>Kill.</i> <i>Time to kill.</i> Caught in the act. I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words. No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand... Professor... ...I swear I didn't. This is out of my hands, Potter. Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet Lemon. Professor Dumbledore? Bee in your bonnet, Potter? I was just wondering if you put me in the right house. Yes. You were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said last year. You would have done well in Slytherin. You're wrong. Harry? Professor. Your bird... There was nothing I could do. - He just caught fire. - And about time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die... ...and then they are... ...reborn from the ashes. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads. Their tears have healing powers. Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry. I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic. Relax. I do not believe... ...that Harry attacked anyone. - Of course you don't. Right. Well, I'II... - I'll just wait outside, then. - Yes. - You don't think it was me, professor? - No, Harry. I do not think it was you. But I must ask you... ...is there something you wish to tell me? No, sir. Nothing. Very well, then. Off you go. Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into. Crabbe and Goyle. We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle... ...can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy. - How? - I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep... ...hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs... ...and put on their uniforms. - Whose hair are you ripping out, then? - I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin. I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these. Ron, maybe I should do it. Yeah. Right. <i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i> Cool. How thick could you get? Come on, let's get them. We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves. Add the hairs. Essence of Crabbe. Cheers. I think I'm gonna be sick. Me too. Harry? Ron. Bloody hell! We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe. - Bloody hell. - Excellent. - But where's Hermione? - I... I don't think I'm going. You go on without me. Hermione, are you okay? Just go. You're wasting time. Come on. I think the Slytherin common room's this way. Excuse me. What are you doing d...? I mean, what are you doing down here? I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night. What are your names again? - I'm... - Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses? - Reading. - Reading? I didn't know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley? Mind your attitude, Malfoy. Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe? Stomachache. <i>I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.</i> I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing... ...that ever happened to this place. - You're wrong! What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore? Well? Do you? Harry Potter? Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin? But then you must have some idea who's behind it all. You know I don't, Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it. Only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me... ...I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting very odd. It's his stomachache. Calm down. Scar. Hair. Hey! Where are you going? That was close. Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you. Go away. Wait till you see. It's awful. Hermione? Are you okay? Do you remember me telling you... ...that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face. Look at your tail. Have you spoken to Hermione? She should be out of hospital in a few days... ...when she stops coughing up fur balls. What's this? Yuck! Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom. - Come to throw something else at me? - Why would I throw something at you? Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business... ...and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me. But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you. Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it. Ten points if you get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head! - But who threw it at you, anyway? - I don't know. I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death... ...and it fell through the top of my head. ""Tom Marvolo Riddle. "" My name... ...is Harry... ...Potter. Do you know anything... ...about the Chamber of Secrets? Can you... ...tell me? Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle? Hello, can you hear me? Riddle! Come. Professor Dumbledore. Dumbledore? It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom. Yes, professor. I suppose I... I had to see for myself if the rumors were true. I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true. About the school as well? I don't have a home to go to. They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, professor? I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid... ...Headmaster Dippet may have no choice. Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught... Is there something... ...you wish to tell me? No, sir. Nothing. Very well, then. Off you go. Good night, sir. - Let's get you out of there. - Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone... You can't. You don't understand. The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do... ...is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered. It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one. Never. Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. - Now, stand aside. - No! - Stand aside, Hagrid. - No! <i>Cistem Aperio!</i> <i>Arania Exumai!</i> Aragog! Aragog! I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled. Hagrid! It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago. It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be. We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch. The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done? Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it? That would be a cheerful visit. ""Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"" Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you? No. What's that you've got, Hagrid? It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, you know. Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing to do. But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them... ...and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three... ...had best be looking after yourselves. All right? Hello, Neville. Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come. Come on! It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless it wasn't a student. Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something. And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone. All right, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter. Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them... ...if they fly anywhere near him. - Well, that too. Professor McGonagall. - This match has been canceled. - We can't cancel Quidditch. Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see. I warn you. This could be a wee bit of a shock. Hermione! She was found near the library... ...along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you? No. Could I have your attention, please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately: ""All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions. "" I should tell you this: Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught... ...it is likely the school will be closed. We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him... ...but if he did set the monster loose last time... ...he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start. But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class. I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again. Who's there? Hello? Hello? - What's that for? - Nothing. I was expecting... It doesn't matter. Come on in. I just made a pot of tea. Hagrid, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm all right. Did you hear about Hermione? Yeah. I heard about that, all right. Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets? What you had to understand about that is... Quick, under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both of you. - Professor Dumbledore, sir. - Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we...? Of course. Come in. Come in. That's Dad's boss. Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic. Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business. Had to come. Three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. - The Ministry's got to act. - But I never... You know I never, professor. I want it understood, Cornelius... ...that Hagrid... ...has my full confidence. Albus, look, Hagrid's record is against him. - I've got to take him. - Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban prison. I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid. Already here, Fudge? Good. What are you doing here? Get out of my house! Believe me... ...I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your... You call this a house? No. I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here. Well, what exactly is it that you want with me? The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all 12 signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks... ...there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school. You can't take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance. You mark my words, there'll be killings next! You think so? Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal... ...I will, of course, step aside. However... ...you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts... ...to those who... ...ask for it. Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge. Come, Hagrid. Well? Lf... If anybody was looking for some stuff... ...then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yep. That would lead them right. That's all I have to say. And someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away. Good boy. Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day. Look. Come on. Come on, Fang. Come on. What? You heard what Hagrid said. ""Follow the spiders. "" They're heading to the Dark Forest. Why spiders? Why couldn't it be ""follow the butterflies""? Harry, I don't like this. - Harry, I don't like this at all. - Shush! Can we go back now? Come on. Who is it? Don't panic. Hagrid? Is that you? We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? You're Aragog, aren't you? Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before. He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. That's a lie. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. - Then you're not the monster? - No. The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler. Harry. But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago? We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. But have you seen it? I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here. - Harry! - What? Well, thank you. We'll just go. Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat... ...when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friend of Hagrid. Can we panic now? Know any spells? One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them. Where's Hermione when you need her? Let's go! <i>Arania Exumai!</i> Go! Glad we're out of there. <i>Arania Exumai!</i> - Thanks for that. - Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on, move faster! Come on! Go! Get us in the air. The flying gear's jammed! - Come on! Pull! - I'm trying! Follow the spiders. Follow the spiders. If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him. I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? - What have we found out? - We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent. Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever. - What's that? - Ron... This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. Come on. ""Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land... ...none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years... ...instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it. "" Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake. But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead? Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it. But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again. And Hermione had the mirror. I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along. And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry. The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. ""Spiders flee before it. "" - It all fits. - How's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty, great snake. Someone would have seen it. - Hermione's answered that too. - Pipes? It's using the plumbing. Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left? Moaning Myrtle. <i>All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.</i> <i>All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.</i> As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts. So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed? A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last. - My moment? - Weren't you saying just last night... ...that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is? That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. - Your skills, after all, are legend. - Very well. I'll just be in my office getting... Getting ready. Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva? Ginny Weasley. ""Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. "" Ginny. Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know. Professor, we have some information for you. Are you going somewhere? Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Got to go. - What about my sister? - Well... As to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I. You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can't go now. I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description... You're running away? - After all you did in your books? - Books can be misleading. - You wrote them. - My dear boy, use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think I'd done those things. You're a fraud. You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done. Is there anything you can do? Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. I'd never have sold another book. In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you. Don't even think about it. Who's there? Hello, Harry. - What do you want? - To ask you how you died. It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. - Who was it, Myrtle? - I don't know. I was distraught! But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language. And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and... ...I died. - Just like that? How? I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes... ...over there by that sink. This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue. Excellent, Harry. Good work. Well, then, I'll just be... There's no need for me to stay. Yes, there is. - You first. - Now, boys, what good will it do? Better you than us. But... Obviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? It's really quite filthy down here. - All right. Let's go. - Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. Thanks, Myrtle. Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway. Go on. This way. - What's this? - It looks like a snake. - It's a snakeskin. - Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more. Heart of a lion, this one. The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds... ...at the sight of her mangled body. So... You first, Mr. Potter. Say goodbye to your memories. <i>Obliviate!</i> - Ron! Ron, are you okay? - I'm fine. Hello. Who are you? - Ron Weasley. - Really? And who am I? Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is. It's an odd sort of place, isn't it? Do you live here? - No. - Really? - What do I do now? - You wait here... ...and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. - I'll go on and find Ginny. - Okay. Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up, wake up. Please wake up. She won't wake. Tom. Tom Riddle. What do you mean, she won't wake? - She's not...? - She's still alive, but only just. - Are you a ghost? - A memory... ...preserved in a diary for 50 years. She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk. It won't come until it's called. - Give me my wand, Tom. - You won't be needing it. - We've got to go. We've got to save her. - I'm afraid I can't do that. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets. No. She couldn't. She wouldn't. It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat... ...Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. - But why? - Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. And then who should find it but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet. And why did you want to meet me? I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid... ...to gain your trust. - Hagrid's my friend. - And you framed him, didn't you? - It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent. I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you. He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was at school... ...so I decided to leave behind a diary... ...preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages... ...so that one day I would be able to lead another... ...to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work. Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready. And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again. Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target has been you. How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent... ...was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar... ...while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed? Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time. Voldemort is my past, present and future. You. You're the Heir of Slytherin. - You're Voldemort. - Surely you didn't think... ...I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere... ...would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world. Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world. Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me. He'll never be gone. Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him. Fawkes? So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender. A songbird and an old hat. Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin... ...against the famous Harry Potter. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me. No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you. Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete. In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return... ...very much alive. Ginny? Remarkable, isn't it... ...how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do... ...especially in the hands of a silly little girl. What are you doing? Stop. No! It was me. But I swear, I didn't mean to. Riddle made me, and... Harry, you're hurt. Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough. Of course. Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks. It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory. Amazing! This is just like magic! You both realize, of course... ...that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules. Yes, sir. There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled. Yes, sir. Therefore, it is only fitting... ...that you both receive... ...Special Awards for Services to the School. Thanks, sir. Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would... ...have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. I believe we want our gamekeeper back. First, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And... ...second... ...I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry? It's just... You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain... Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me. I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry... ...he transferred some of his powers to you... ...the night he gave you that scar. Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me? Not intentionally... ...but yes. So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be in Slytherin. It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness... ...and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor? - Because I asked it to. - Exactly, Harry. Exactly. Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor... ...then I suggest you look more closely at this. Be careful. Godric Gryffindor. It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat. Dobby. So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys. I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter. So it's true. You have returned. When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter... ...was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. - Ridiculous. - Curiously, Lucius, several of them... ...were under the impression that you would curse their family... ...if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place. - How dare you! - Beg your pardon? My sole concern has always been and will always be... ...the welfare of this school... ...and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume? Yes. And? Who was it? Voldemort. Only this time he chose to act through somebody else... ...by means of this. I see. Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things... ...should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be... ...severe. Well, let us hope... ...that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day. Don't worry. I will be. Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving. Sir? I wonder if I could have that? Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours. Mine? I don't know what you're talking about. I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron... ...that day at Diagon Alley. You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Open it. Dobby. Master has given Dobby a sock. What? I didn't give... Master has presented Dobby with clothes. Dobby is free. You lost me my servant! You shall not harm Harry Potter. Your parents were meddlesome fools too. Mark my words, Potter. One day soon... ...you are going to meet the same sticky end. Harry Potter freed Dobby. How can Dobby ever repay him? - Just promise me something. - Anything, sir. Never try to save my life again. - Welcome back, Sir Nicholas. - Thank you. - Good evening, Sir Nicholas. - Good evening. - Good to see you, Sir Nicholas. - Thank you. Hello. - Hermione! Welcome back. - Thanks, Sir Nicholas. Harry. It's Hermione. - Welcome back, Hermione. - It's good to be back. Congratulations. I can't believe you solved it. We had loads of help from you. - We couldn't have done it without you. - Thanks. Could I have your attention, please? Before we begin the feast... ...let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey... ...whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered... ...to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events... ...as a school treat... ...all exams have been canceled. <i>Oh, no.</i> Sorry I'm late. The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron... ...and Hermione, of course... ...I would still be you-know-where... ...so I'd just like to say thanks. There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.",0.7357389330863953,0.6388503015041351,0.8231570720672607,0.11397997289896011,0.4187958389520645,0.3426327407360077
